1orfa1r,,comment,"There’s no point in allocating a budget if it isn’t actually being used for the right purposes.

We need proper laws in place before anything . Without legislation mandating that all pet dogs and cats must be spayed or neutered, every other effort becomes meaningless. The main reason behind the growing stray dog and cat population is irresponsible pet ownership. There must also be strict laws to punish those who abandon puppies and kittens.

People should not be allowed to breed and sell animals without proper regulation. There have been far too many cases of people overbreeding their pets and abandoning them once they grow old.

There should be affordable rabies vaccination programs across the country. Government veterinary services are becoming increasingly rare. A few years ago in my area, it was possible to have a dog spayed at a government clinic for half the cost of a private vet, but even that option is no longer available.",13,/r/srilanka/comments/1orfa1r/life_for_stray_dogs_what_do_you_think_about_this/nnq5k00/,1762582100.0

1orfa1r,,comment,"Get rid of stray dogs. They are a menace. If you want pets, have them in your homes. Letting them roam freely around high traffic and children has proven to be very dangerous. 

My friend met with an accident caused by a dog 5 years ago. She lost few of her teeth and had a spine injury. Last month she had to give birth via c section instead of vaginally because of the spinal injury. She also had a difficult pregnancy due to the back aches. These dogs cause long lasting issues. 

I've visited a few government hospitals which allow dogs to roam around and there's always dog poop all over. I've also once seen a stretcher-tire tracks of poop dragged along a hallway of a hospital. Out of all the places in the world, one would expect the hospital to be most sanitary but this is the situation.

1orfa1r,,comment,"the issue with putting them down means as soon as they get rid of one set of dogs, it gives space for another group to take over. So it's a sad sad cycle. 

The best thing to do is to spay and neuter. That way, the more docile of the dogs hang around, and within one generation, the stray dog population goes into decline.

Right now the big issue is that there is a large portion of the population who does the whole ""පව් අනේ!"" and they let dogs breed, and suddenly we are inundated with puppies.

1oqozon,,comment,"What Google ai said 👇


While DCP files can be technically transferred via the internet, they are generally not available for public consumer download in the same way you might download a movie from a streaming service. 
Here's why:
Security and Anti-Piracy: DCPs are the master distribution format for cinemas and are highly protected content. They are usually encrypted with advanced Digital Rights Management (DRM) and require a specific Key Delivery Message (KDM) to be played. A KDM is tied to a specific cinema server and only allows playback during a designated time window, making it difficult to share or pirate the content.
File Size: A feature-length film in a DCP format can easily be 100 Gigabytes or more. For general internet users, downloading files of this size is often impractical due to bandwidth limitations and time constraints.
Specialized Format: The files use highly specific technical standards (e.g., JPEG 2000 compression in XYZ color space, MXF wrappers, specific audio channels) that are designed for professional cinema servers, not consumer-grade media players.
Commercial Distribution: The primary method for distributing films to the public is through streaming platforms (like Netflix, Amazon Prime) or physical media (Blu-ray, DVD), which use different, more consumer-friendly, and less secure formats. 
Who uses internet transfers?
For professionals in the film industry, electronic delivery (download links) is used, but this is typically through specialized file transfer services to authorized recipients (e.g., film festivals or post-production houses). The recipient still needs the correct hardware and software to ingest and play the package. 
In summary, the DCP format is a professional tool for secure, high-quality cinematic projection and is not intended for general consumer use or download.",-19,/r/srilanka/comments/1oqozon/not_even_movie_releases_are_safe_from_sl_customs/nnm1gbk/,1762530124.0

The english word ""firewall"" is actually quite old and refers to physical walls in buildings that are designed to prevent the spread of fire - not a wall made of fire. So maybe it should be ජාලගත ගිනි ආරක්ෂිත පවුර. Or ජාලගත ආරක්ෂිත පවුර or something. It feels like whoever is in charge of these official translations doesn't really look into the etymology or meaning of the english term and they just do some weird overly-literal translation instead.  

Other languages like french place a lot of importance on native words and try to avoid english borrowings, and I think that's fine. The same goes for lots of languages, but it seems like a lot of sri lankans see this as a waste of time. I don't get why this would ever be ""cringey"", but maybe that's because europe as a whole is going through a time where attitudes are shifting and minority languages are actively being protected and promoted.

2) If you are going to teach the STEM subjects to kids in their mother tongue till AL, then you have to have a University Education in the same mother tongue

2nd option is what they mostly do in Europe countries. They totally changed their education system to their language hence giving no hassle to students.

I personally think they should fully switch to English medium for STEM subjects. Because it is the practical option. They should mainstream it while still having the tamil, sinhala versions of it in side and gradually fully transform STEM to English.

But in university, all the streams are done almost exclusively in English. They learn the terms all over again in English. But its easier for them since they already learned the basics in a language comfortable to them.

1oq9vd4,,comment,"I am not saying to make a single language mandatory. I am just saying to make English medium mainstream for STEM subjects while still having the option to choose Tamil or Sinhala medium if they wanted to.(Kinda like how English Medium exist right now in schools). I am not saying to make the switch overnight. It is a long process which would probably takes years to finish. I am just saying to put the stepping stone today.   
  
I heard what you said about Rural area kids and I don't think switching them hereafter will benefit them since most are already in the Secondary education in their mother tongue. I am saying to make this switch from future generations on wards. Like starting it from the new upcoming Grade 1 students. Building them a good English learning environment from their primary years in school will make English natural to them just like their mother tongue. They can't take English as input from outside resources due to the limitations rural areas. That is why good English learning environment is needed in the rural school they go to. Plus most village areas (correct me If I am wrong) have the access to internet due to having Phones. Rural area kids can make use of their phones to search and read and get pdfs in English language and they can increase their scope of Knowledge much more if they had a good English knowledge. They get to explore a whole new world with their English knowledge because there are enormous amount of resources in English. They can learn what is going on all around the world without having to rely on local media only and shape their character, perspectives and views. 

I know this is not an easy task. For this kind of change to be made, it will take a  long time and resources. Every teachers should have a standardized proficiency in English and IT if they are going to teach in Government Schools. This should be much more authorized  and should undergo rigorous checking. Teachers should be very well versed in their subjects that the rural kids never want to search for tuition to study well. This kind of change is what i like to see. Our country's society made English as some ""posh"" thing that only the western province people know. I want to see a change that English should become just a language, losing its ""posh"" status. It should be something natural and easily accessible to all the children in our country, regardless of where they are born and never feel left out. 

I am a person who values mother tongue sincerely. But I can't deny that English opens a whole new world to a individual, breaking the language barrier. Our country is not like Germany or Japan. Those countries do their maximum to translate every resources in to their mother tongue. But our country is not like that. There are still so many books and resources without a proper Tamil and Sinhala translations.

1oq9vd4,,comment,"It's about common sense, Go to a village in SL and show a kid a mouse, see whether they call it ""moosikaya"", or a computer a ""pariganakaya"", The list goes on...

And Uni, Yeah right, with the pace it's going (Seriously, try to relearn the things you learned in AL maths for Machine Learning formulas, U'd have a blast;) ) , one can choose to spend the first year relearning things and familiarizing the language, or... they could actually socialize, do certifications and stuff while they have time, Cuz by the time they get out of uni the competition is like bread in a fish pond.

And believe it or not most kids don't think about uni when choosing O/L subjects, especially with the SL education system that sells the dream ""A/L godadammama okkoma hari"". So removing the option forces them to adapt. Besides teachers will explain things in the native language when they see that kids are having a hard time.",9,/r/srilanka/comments/1oq9vd4/the_demographic_of_this_sub_definitely_had/nniuism/,1762479185.0
1oq9vd4,,comment,"Dude I already explained why it isn't really a logical solution. You are severely overestimating the English proficiency of an average  Sri lankan student. 

Yeah no shit no one uses those terms in real life, that's why they allow writing English terms,

but I'm talking about a student's ability to take an exam fully in English. As I said people do more advanced subjects in their mother language because of convenience. 
I took bio in English because it's easier for me.

So why take away the chance of a poor kid to choose IT  O/l because they aren't good at English. 

It's a choice, what harm is it doing for to take away that.

If they make a language mandatory,then it's severely more advantageous to students from more ""privileged"" provinces.

I repeat, the complainers in that post  did that to themselves. Literally no reason to do it in Sinhala if they are comfortable with English. 😄

That being said -

1. Lolly's is a 24/7 cafe you can work at.  
2. Easiest way to find accomodations would be to rent a van or car and sleeping in it. Other than temples there's almost no place you can just sleep outside in the middle of Colombo especially if you're not from here. 
3. you will absolutely be robbed if you are careless.
4. Water will be free if you just ask someone - you could just go to any public bathroom and clean yourself without too much trouble if it's early or late. 
5. People are not going to understand what you're doing and will be confused if you try to explain, so it's better to just not.

1omg7pp,,comment,"I think the best place to stay the night is the Maradana railway station. The last train from the station is at 11.05 PM and the first one is at 3.05 PM. use this information to say something if someone asks why you are here.

Then there is Diyatha Uyana, very easy to sneak in. Just spend one day scoping the behaviour of the security guards after 11.00PM. They usually do routine checks with flashlights after 11.00 PM. It is not very thorough, and I don't know when they stop doing the checks after midnight. Because Diyatha has direct access to the main road without any gates or anything, the scoping will be easy.

And I think Galleface is also a good place for you to spend the night, and the city of dreams Lakefront is all a potential location. Both of these places have pros and cons. pro is there is always people around and the con is there is always people around.

Or, if you are brazen enough, you can admit to the general hospital at night and try to get discharged in the morning. When you are admitted after 11 PM, you are not directed to a Ward; you are directed to the unit called ECU, and only after the morning routine doctor round, you will be allocated to a ward.  That is 8.00 AM. You have to be there until then and say you want to be discharged at your own accord when the doctor comes.

There is another place that you can spend your night around Colombo, and I would say the probability that you will get the chance to stay there is not zero. A jail cell.",5,/r/srilanka/comments/1omg7pp/minimal_life_survival_challenge_in_colombo/nmut3ra/,1762164229.0

It is really hard to stop these things, because they have a well-planned structure for this harassment. It's like a project report(approved by seniors). These ragging cases started since 70s, influenced by radicalized left-wing political parties.   
WORST THING:- same harassment and political view structure still active in most top-rated school hostel facilities. It's the same 100%! Most people don't know that, my opinion is that it was also influenced by radicalized political parties in the 80s!

I would say forms of ragging would have been present in the British Rule era, as well as ancient Sri Lanka. 
So we cannot claim h=that one political group is the originator.

But when the world was becoming enlightened about the problems of “initiation rituals” certain political ideologies would have amplified the existing discontent towards the elite class, and would have taken a sadistic turn to dole out “equality” to elites comings from certain social strata. 

Those who have gone through these ragging/rituals, justify their trials and the pain and create a “dissonance” within themselves to think that they are “better to have gone through it”.

It's a language spoken by about 17 million people (as 1st language and 3 to 4 million as second language. 20 million people among 8 billion speak Sinhala in a small little island. What benefit does studying higher studies in Sinhala serve to an individual? None whatsoever. And it would prove to be a bigger disadvantage when it comes to pursuing further higher studies (like masters or PhD or literally anything one could do academically abroad).

Native German speakers are about 76 million, second language speakers are about 58 million. So in total about a 134 million people around the world currently are able to speak German. In fact German can be learnt anywhere in the world, no matter where you live. As a matter of fact, the school I studied in, we learnt German from grade 6 to 8. We then learnt French in grade 9. Although this is a leading boys' school in Sri Lanka, I am sure anybody who wants to learn in our country can learn it for free on their own convenience.

This is why some don't come back. On top of that their kids get way better opportunities than being here in LK.

And yet it has one of the best healthcare education systems that churn out tons of doctors that they can regularly sends its doctors abroad on free medical missions to serve other countries.

1oklnoh,,comment,"I am just curious do you even know the process which is required to become a consultant ? Have you or any of your relatives been accepted into medical school ? Even I didn't know about it until a few years ago. After finding out I decided I would never recommend anyone going down this path.

1. You need to get high enough grades to get into state universities

2. After finishing University ( 4- 5 years )you need to go through an internship of another year 

3. After this you will be giving your first posting which could be in a far way hospital with no safety , no security , minimal facilities for another 4-5 years . A lot of these places may not even have doctors quarters so you have to rent a place.

4. Although government doctors salaries  are supposed to be in line with those of other government staff in similar grades it is not. This is why they are given car permits as well.

5. Then if you want to become a consultant you have to pay to register for the exams. You will be refunded only if you pass.

6. If you pass the entrance exam to become a consultant then your salary is reduced & your regular leave is cancelled . You will only have sick leave. This is because they consider you a "" post graduate trainee"". 

7. This training period will go for al least another 4-5 years with exams as well. Then another year of training abroad.

8. There is very minimal cost to the government as post graduate trainees have on the job training. They don't sit in classrooms. They have to treat patients & learn at the same time during these 4-5 years. The cost to the government is only printing their student ID cards & the paper used to print notices / exam papers.

9. When going abroad for their final year of training consultants have to sign a bond.

10. So you have to work & study for at least  11-12  years or more to become a consultant 

11. Once you come back to Sri Lanka you are put into a new allocation list & there is a chance you will again be sent to a far off hospital with minimal facilities for another 4-5 years.

Cuba has one of the highest doctor-to-patients ratios (roughly 8-9 doctors / 1000 people, it's about 1-1.6 / 1000 in SL) but most of them are general practitioners or family physicians. Not specialists. Cuba has long wait times for specialised surgeries and diagnostic procedures. There's a drastic unequal distribution of doctors between cities and rural areas. There's also high dependence on referrals abroad to Venezuela or Mexico for the same. The plea by the Health Minister here is also for specialist doctors, not general practitioners. 

One of the primary factors causing this is the brain drain. The Cuban government themselves have admitted this and imposed travel restrictions on healthcare professionals. (This has been covered by Human Rights Watch) The ones that are even sent on missions abroad, the state collects most of their earnings and the doctors try and not return.

1oklnoh,,comment,">Cuba has long wait times for specialised surgeries and diagnostic procedures

>There's a drastic unequal distribution of doctors between cities and rural areas

>There's also high dependence on referrals abroad to Venezuela or Mexico for the same

I'm sure the 65 year long complete embargo on trade with Cuba had nothing to do with the above issues, or the fact that their largest trade partner no longer existing since 1991 had no effect on their current material conditions. Specialist equipment and medicine grows on sugar cane trees -_-

But that's besides the point. I'm not a doctor nor does my field of expertise lie in medicine, so if a medical professional reads this they can correct me: 

My understanding is that preventative care and early diagnosis that is afforded by gps is the primary driver of patient wellbeing. It's easier to treat a condition that is caught early than it is to treat it when its been allowed to fester. This is not the case for everything I know, but it's probably true for a pretty big chunk of health conditions. Because I see no other way to explain the high lifespan and low infant mortality rate they have given everything else they endure. This is why I consider the cuban model to be superior. Yes there is a lack of specialists, but Cuba does not need as many specialists because medical conditions are caught and treated early which reduces the need for specialists.

>The Cuban government themselves have admitted this and imposed travel restrictions on healthcare professionals. (This has been covered by Human Rights Watch)

The fact that the Cuban government said it's a criminal offense for a doctor to neglect their duty of care during a pandemic, is something to be lauded lmao wtf.

As for the right to associate with people hostile to Cuba, I mean, what do you expect? They are living inside America's ass cheeks, the same country that firebombed them and tried and failed to invade them in the bay of pigs fiasco. And this rule was put in place during the first Trump term too. How naive should they be not to have a rule like that in place? Might as well roll out the red carpet for CIA goons at that point... 

But we are deviating from Cuba's medical policies into something else now. I believe I answered your question why I think cuba's model is superior for their material condition. Sri Lanka can take a similar approach, and given that we aren't being embargoed, can probably improve on that model too",-2,/r/srilanka/comments/1oklnoh/i_dont_think_they_will_come_back/nmcqjrj/,1761910652.0

1ojtxz7,,comment,"First of all small dude, I didn't say anything about kids or being gay or anything that was homophobic rhetoric. Just because you think in a certain way doesn't warrant us thinking in the same way.
​And for the statistical inclinations, below is a small part of the answer that I've got from Gemini. (You could've done this by yourself before making the comment)

​""Aggression: Meta-analyses (e.g., Archer, 2004) consistently show that males, on average, engage in more physical aggression than females. This difference is moderate to large and is observable from early childhood.
Risk-Taking: Males, on average, are statistically more inclined to take risks across multiple domains, including physical, financial, and social risks.
Empathy: The results here are nuanced. While ""empathy"" is complex, studies often find that females, on average, score higher on measures of affective empathy (feeling what another person is feeling) and social sensitivity.
Spatial Ability: Males, on average, tend to perform better on specific spatial tasks, particularly 3D mental rotation (the ability to imagine rotating an object in space).""",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1ojtxz7/does_anyone_else_get_annoyed_by_shit_like_this/nm5tjch/,1761815741.0

So I looked up ""diaspora"" to see how many generations would have to pass until someone isn't classified as diaspora, it varies.

1oi30hx,,comment,"Let me tell you about Indians in Australia mate. While there are some of them legally migrated to the country paid taxes, educated their children and have become ideal citizens most of them nowadays are students and temporary visa holders entering the country. Students they sign up for some unknown university or college for some “IT degree” with the sole purpose of not studying but doing a job and earning. Even once their visa duration is over they still hand around in the country to make as much as money possible until they get caught to some illegal migration enforcement agency and forcibly get deported. Same with the temp visa holders as well. They enter the country to do a particular profession but end up doing all kinds of odd jobs and overstay their visa and be illegal aliens. I see this is happening in Sri Lanka as well. Unless the current government takes some drastic action to cull the Indian population in Sri Lanka very soon all of us will not have a country for ourselves. I sincerely hope for the betterment of we Sri Lankan’s and our children the government takes some stern action to get rid of this illegal Indians who have entered Sri Lanka.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1oi30hx/what_kind_of_visas_are_those_indians_in_sri_lanka/nluz6fe/,1761671664.0

I bet the original proposal was to bring in the immigrants who work for piss poor wages to counterbalance this supposed ""sever shortage of labor"" over in Canada too. 

But it has pushed down the wage standards and distorted the whole labour market. Even in the trucking industry. Once wage depression sets in, it stays that way for generations. Wherever the Indians go, they scam the system and make that happen.

They're going to create long term infiltration if brought in for skilled jobs, no Indian should be given managerial or HR positions in a company, they only hire their own kind afterwards. Indian nepotism is disgusting in the tech industry in North America. No other minority has that practice, not Latin Americans, not Africans, not Philippinos, it's only them.

Do not even think about replacing the local labor force with those people, if Sri Lankans are being lazy and rather drive tuktuks, the reasons for that should be figured out and found solutions for.

I looked it up real quick and found this:

“The Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) of Sri Lanka requires any foreign contractor doing ‘identified construction work’ to register with them under the Construction Industry Development Act No. 33 of 2014.”

Is the government actually issuing work permits for them? 🤢🤮 Because that’s diabolical if true. Their work quality is abysmal. I had the huge misfortune of working with two Indian mechanical engineers when I was in Colombo (they were brought in by the American company that built the US Embassy there), and neither of them even knew how to draft in AutoCAD.

1oha8xg,,comment,"Malaria rlly was a big problem here from immemorial time, the worst recorded being from 1934-35, in which 1.5 million got infected with Malaria. This was when the population was still somewhere between 5-6 million, meaning that 1/5 to 1/4, got infected Malaria, which isn't a joke. How incapacitated would it be for anyone to do anything, thank goodness concerted efforts led to Malaria being 'eliminated' in 2016, with concerted efforts of Anti-Malaria Campaign, us now being in the prevention of re establishment phase.

It rlly was a whole century of progress. According to Anti-Malaria Campaign Website ;

1911: Organized malaria control activities commenced with the establishment of the Anti Malaria Campaign in Kurunegala.

1934-1935: A massive malaria epidemic occurred in Sri Lanka, causing widespread cases and deaths.

1946: Introduction of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), leading to a steady decline in malaria morbidity and mortality.

1958: The newly independent Government of Ceylon launched a malaria eradication program, aligned with WHO recommendations.

1963: Near eradication status was achieved, with only 17 reported cases (11 of which were imported).

1967-1969: A major setback occurred, culminating in a massive malaria epidemic.

1989: The program was transformed into a decentralized campaign, implemented by 9 provincial health authorities under the technical guidance of the National Anti Malaria Campaign Directorate.

2009: Sri Lanka embarked on a phased malaria pre-elimination program after the end of the separatist war.

2011: The malaria elimination program was launched.

October 2012: The last case of indigenous malaria was reported.

2016 (September 5): Sri Lanka was declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization.",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1oha8xg/sri_lankas_healthcare_system_is_one_of_the_good/nlrz3k7/,1761626955.0

1oeydya,,comment,"People in this sub often defend the treatment of elephants in this country claiming it's for religious or cultural purposes. Well, this is what the government and people of another Buddhist country which also gives Buddhism a special place in its constitution thinks of their treatment-an international embarrassment;


""The Thai government is set to hold talks with Sri Lanka on October 28 to bring back two elephants that were gifted by Thailand, following reports of poor living conditions and alleged mistreatment.


Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), Suchart Chomklin, wrote on his Facebook page yesterday, October 23, that he plans to fly urgently to Sri Lanka amid growing concerns about the welfare of the two Thai elephants, Plai Pratu Pha and Plai Srinarong.


Concerns were first raised last year by the Reclaim Thai Elephant group. The group’s coordinator, Yuwanuch Kiattiwong, together with 50 members, visited the MONRE to submit an official letter urging the government to take action over the elephants’ poor living conditions.


According to the group, the elephants, which were originally gifted by Thailand, have been forced to work excessively and deprived of proper welfare standards. The animals were reportedly kept in chains at all times and beaten. The group called for their immediate return to Thailand to ensure a better quality of life.""",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1oeydya/thai_government_moves_to_bring_back_2_gifted/nl4yi2s/,1761314217.0

1orfa1r,,comment,"There’s no point in allocating a budget if it isn’t actually being used for the right purposes.

We need proper laws in place before anything . Without legislation mandating that all pet dogs and cats must be spayed or neutered, every other effort becomes meaningless. The main reason behind the growing stray dog and cat population is irresponsible pet ownership. There must also be strict laws to punish those who abandon puppies and kittens.

People should not be allowed to breed and sell animals without proper regulation. There have been far too many cases of people overbreeding their pets and abandoning them once they grow old.

There should be affordable rabies vaccination programs across the country. Government veterinary services are becoming increasingly rare. A few years ago in my area, it was possible to have a dog spayed at a government clinic for half the cost of a private vet, but even that option is no longer available.",11,/r/srilanka/comments/1orfa1r/life_for_stray_dogs_what_do_you_think_about_this/nnq5k00/,1762582100.0

1orfa1r,,comment,"Get rid of stray dogs. They are a menace. If you want pets, have them in your homes. Letting them roam freely around high traffic and children has proven to be very dangerous. 

My friend met with an accident caused by a dog 5 years ago. She lost few of her teeth and had a spine injury. Last month she had to give birth via c section instead of vaginally because of the spinal injury. She also had a difficult pregnancy due to the back aches. These dogs cause long lasting issues. 

I've visited a few government hospitals which allow dogs to roam around and there's always dog poop all over. I've also once seen a stretcher-tire tracks of poop dragged along a hallway of a hospital. Out of all the places in the world, one would expect the hospital to be most sanitary but this is the situation.

1orfa1r,,comment,"the issue with putting them down means as soon as they get rid of one set of dogs, it gives space for another group to take over. So it's a sad sad cycle. 

The best thing to do is to spay and neuter. That way, the more docile of the dogs hang around, and within one generation, the stray dog population goes into decline.

Right now the big issue is that there is a large portion of the population who does the whole ""පව් අනේ!"" and they let dogs breed, and suddenly we are inundated with puppies.

1oqozon,,comment,"What Google ai said 👇


While DCP files can be technically transferred via the internet, they are generally not available for public consumer download in the same way you might download a movie from a streaming service. 
Here's why:
Security and Anti-Piracy: DCPs are the master distribution format for cinemas and are highly protected content. They are usually encrypted with advanced Digital Rights Management (DRM) and require a specific Key Delivery Message (KDM) to be played. A KDM is tied to a specific cinema server and only allows playback during a designated time window, making it difficult to share or pirate the content.
File Size: A feature-length film in a DCP format can easily be 100 Gigabytes or more. For general internet users, downloading files of this size is often impractical due to bandwidth limitations and time constraints.
Specialized Format: The files use highly specific technical standards (e.g., JPEG 2000 compression in XYZ color space, MXF wrappers, specific audio channels) that are designed for professional cinema servers, not consumer-grade media players.
Commercial Distribution: The primary method for distributing films to the public is through streaming platforms (like Netflix, Amazon Prime) or physical media (Blu-ray, DVD), which use different, more consumer-friendly, and less secure formats. 
Who uses internet transfers?
For professionals in the film industry, electronic delivery (download links) is used, but this is typically through specialized file transfer services to authorized recipients (e.g., film festivals or post-production houses). The recipient still needs the correct hardware and software to ingest and play the package. 
In summary, the DCP format is a professional tool for secure, high-quality cinematic projection and is not intended for general consumer use or download.",-18,/r/srilanka/comments/1oqozon/not_even_movie_releases_are_safe_from_sl_customs/nnm1gbk/,1762530124.0

1oq9vd4,,comment,"English speaker, not a sinhala speaker so I don't care either way. But the translation ""ගිනි පවුර"" feels way off to me. The english word ""firewall"" is actually quite old and refers to physical walls in buildings that are designed to prevent the spread of fire - not a wall made of fire. So maybe it should be ජාලගත ගිනි ආරක්ෂිත පවුර. Or ජාලගත ආරක්ෂිත පවුර or something. It feels like whoever is in charge of these official translations doesn't really look into the etymology or meaning of the english term and they just do some weird overly-literal translation instead.  

Other languages like french place a lot of importance on native words and try to avoid english borrowings, and I think that's fine. The same goes for lots of languages, but it seems like a lot of sri lankans see this as a waste of time. I don't get why this would ever be ""cringey"", but maybe that's because europe as a whole is going through a time where attitudes are shifting and minority languages are actively being protected and promoted.

2) If you are going to teach the STEM subjects to kids in their mother tongue till AL, then you have to have a University Education in the same mother tongue

2nd option is what they mostly do in Europe countries. They totally changed their education system to their language hence giving no hassle to students.

I personally think they should fully switch to English medium for STEM subjects. Because it is the practical option. They should mainstream it while still having the tamil, sinhala versions of it in side and gradually fully transform STEM to English.

But in university, all the streams are done almost exclusively in English. They learn the terms all over again in English. But its easier for them since they already learned the basics in a language comfortable to them.

I am just saying to make English medium mainstream for STEM subjects while still having the option to choose Tamil or Sinhala medium if they wanted to.(Kinda like how English Medium exist right now in schools). I am not saying to make the switch overnight. It is a long process which would probably takes years to finish. I am just saying to put the stepping stone today.   
  
I heard what you said about Rural area kids and I don't think switching them hereafter will benefit them since most are already in the Secondary education in their mother tongue. I am saying to make this switch from future generations on wards. Like starting it from the new upcoming Grade 1 students. Building them a good English learning environment from their primary years in school will make English natural to them just like their mother tongue. They can't take English as input from outside resources due to the limitations rural areas. That is why good English learning environment is needed in the rural school they go to. Plus most village areas (correct me If I am wrong) have the access to internet due to having Phones. Rural area kids can make use of their phones to search and read and get pdfs in English language and they can increase their scope of Knowledge much more if they had a good English knowledge. They get to explore a whole new world with their English knowledge because there are enormous amount of resources in English. They can learn what is going on all around the world without having to rely on local media only and shape their character, perspectives and views. 

I know this is not an easy task. For this kind of change to be made, it will take a  long time and resources. Every teachers should have a standardized proficiency in English and IT if they are going to teach in Government Schools. This should be much more authorized  and should undergo rigorous checking. Teachers should be very well versed in their subjects that the rural kids never want to search for tuition to study well. This kind of change is what i like to see. Our country's society made English as some ""posh"" thing that only the western province people know. I want to see a change that English should become just a language, losing its ""posh"" status. It should be something natural and easily accessible to all the children in our country, regardless of where they are born and never feel left out. 

I am a person who values mother tongue sincerely. But I can't deny that English opens a whole new world to a individual, breaking the language barrier. Our country is not like Germany or Japan. Those countries do their maximum to translate every resources in to their mother tongue. But our country is not like that.

1oq9vd4,,comment,"It's about common sense, Go to a village in SL and show a kid a mouse, see whether they call it ""moosikaya"", or a computer a ""pariganakaya"", The list goes on...

And Uni, Yeah right, with the pace it's going (Seriously, try to relearn the things you learned in AL maths for Machine Learning formulas, U'd have a blast;) ) , one can choose to spend the first year relearning things and familiarizing the language, or... they could actually socialize, do certifications and stuff while they have time, Cuz by the time they get out of uni the competition is like bread in a fish pond.

And believe it or not most kids don't think about uni when choosing O/L subjects, especially with the SL education system that sells the dream ""A/L godadammama okkoma hari"". So removing the option forces them to adapt. Besides teachers will explain things in the native language when they see that kids are having a hard time.",9,/r/srilanka/comments/1oq9vd4/the_demographic_of_this_sub_definitely_had/nniuism/,1762479185.0
1oq9vd4,,comment,"Dude I already explained why it isn't really a logical solution. You are severely overestimating the English proficiency of an average  Sri lankan student. 

Yeah no shit no one uses those terms in real life, that's why they allow writing English terms,

but I'm talking about a student's ability to take an exam fully in English. As I said people do more advanced subjects in their mother language because of convenience. 
I took bio in English because it's easier for me.

So why take away the chance of a poor kid to choose IT  O/l because they aren't good at English. 

It's a choice, what harm is it doing for to take away that.

If they make a language mandatory,then it's severely more advantageous to students from more ""privileged"" provinces.

I repeat, the complainers in that post  did that to themselves. Literally no reason to do it in Sinhala if they are comfortable with English. 😄

Colombo is a lot of people and 24/7 - you're super likely to attract the worst of us. 

That being said -

1. Lolly's is a 24/7 cafe you can work at.  
2. Easiest way to find accomodations would be to rent a van or car and sleeping in it. Other than temples there's almost no place you can just sleep outside in the middle of Colombo especially if you're not from here. 
3. you will absolutely be robbed if you are careless.
4. Water will be free if you just ask someone - you could just go to any public bathroom and clean yourself without too much trouble if it's early or late. 
5. People are not going to understand what you're doing and will be confused if you try to explain, so it's better to just not.

1omg7pp,,comment,"I think the best place to stay the night is the Maradana railway station. The last train from the station is at 11.05 PM and the first one is at 3.05 PM. use this information to say something if someone asks why you are here.

Then there is Diyatha Uyana, very easy to sneak in. Just spend one day scoping the behaviour of the security guards after 11.00PM. They usually do routine checks with flashlights after 11.00 PM. It is not very thorough, and I don't know when they stop doing the checks after midnight. Because Diyatha has direct access to the main road without any gates or anything, the scoping will be easy.

And I think Galleface is also a good place for you to spend the night, and the city of dreams Lakefront is all a potential location. Both of these places have pros and cons. pro is there is always people around and the con is there is always people around.

Or, if you are brazen enough, you can admit to the general hospital at night and try to get discharged in the morning. When you are admitted after 11 PM, you are not directed to a Ward; you are directed to the unit called ECU, and only after the morning routine doctor round, you will be allocated to a ward.  That is 8.00 AM. You have to be there until then and say you want to be discharged at your own accord when the doctor comes.

There is another place that you can spend your night around Colombo, and I would say the probability that you will get the chance to stay there is not zero. A jail cell.",4,/r/srilanka/comments/1omg7pp/minimal_life_survival_challenge_in_colombo/nmut3ra/,1762164229.0

The reason is to do this type of harassment is to make their mindset toward the activities of the student union (Almost all student union work for JVP, and the anthare work for Peratugami).   
It is really hard to stop these things, because they have a well-planned structure for this harassment. It's like a project report(approved by seniors). These ragging cases started since 70s, influenced by radicalized left-wing political parties.   
WORST THING:- same harassment and political view structure still active in most top-rated school hostel facilities. It's the same 100%! Most people don't know that, my opinion is that it was also influenced by radicalized political parties in the 80s!

1omalo0,,comment,"Ragging or such initiation rituals are not a Sri Lankan phenomenon. Initiation or coming or age rituals, or going through painful trials have been a part of different cultures. 
I would say forms of ragging would have been present in the British Rule era, as well as ancient Sri Lanka. 
So we cannot claim h=that one political group is the originator.

But when the world was becoming enlightened about the problems of “initiation rituals” certain political ideologies would have amplified the existing discontent towards the elite class, and would have taken a sadistic turn to dole out “equality” to elites comings from certain social strata. 

Those who have gone through these ragging/rituals, justify their trials and the pain and create a “dissonance” within themselves to think that they are “better to have gone through it”. So they continue the practice as a dissonance and also a form of revenge (“If we went through it why should the juniors be spared”)",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1omalo0/sri_lankans_pay_tax_money_to_maintain_this_kind/nmsmp75/,1762127668.0

It's a language spoken by about 17 million people (as 1st language and 3 to 4 million as second language. 20 million people among 8 billion speak Sinhala in a small little island. What benefit does studying higher studies in Sinhala serve to an individual? None whatsoever. And it would prove to be a bigger disadvantage when it comes to pursuing further higher studies (like masters or PhD or literally anything one could do academically abroad).

Native German speakers are about 76 million, second language speakers are about 58 million. So in total about a 134 million people around the world currently are able to speak German. In fact German can be learnt anywhere in the world, no matter where you live. As a matter of fact, the school I studied in, we learnt German from grade 6 to 8. We then learnt French in grade 9. Although this is a leading boys' school in Sri Lanka, I am sure anybody who wants to learn in our country can learn it for free on their own convenience.

1oklnoh,,comment,"Give them a reason to come back. They left because LK couldn't offer them the good life they expected. Our doctors are generally underpaid and overworked. On top of that their work life balance is a mess. Especially after you come back from specialist training abroad. They get allocated to outstations and have to work there for years before even thinking of coming back closer to home. The quarters provided are usually pretty bad and in some cases have to find private housings. Traveling to and back from the hospital has to be footed by themselves. In some cases privet practice is a must, not because it's an extra income, but because without it they will not be able to afford a proper living. I know some families where both husband and wife are doctors, and yet are struggling to cover the monthly expenses. Two doctors working abroad can live and enjoy a luxurious life. This is why some don't come back. On top of that their kids get way better opportunities than being here in LK.

Instead of trying to guilt trip them or demanding them to come back, gov should focus on finding out what can attract them back to LK. Gov also needs to focus on creating more doctors to combat future demand.",11,/r/srilanka/comments/1oklnoh/i_dont_think_they_will_come_back/nmc279m/,1761897314.0

1oklnoh,,comment,"I am just curious do you even know the process which is required to become a consultant ? Have you or any of your relatives been accepted into medical school ? Even I didn't know about it until a few years ago. After finding out I decided I would never recommend anyone going down this path.

1. You need to get high enough grades to get into state universities

2. After finishing University ( 4- 5 years )you need to go through an internship of another year 

3. After this you will be giving your first posting which could be in a far way hospital with no safety , no security , minimal facilities for another 4-5 years . A lot of these places may not even have doctors quarters so you have to rent a place.

4. Although government doctors salaries  are supposed to be in line with those of other government staff in similar grades it is not. This is why they are given car permits as well.

5. Then if you want to become a consultant you have to pay to register for the exams. You will be refunded only if you pass.

6. If you pass the entrance exam to become a consultant then your salary is reduced & your regular leave is cancelled . You will only have sick leave. This is because they consider you a "" post graduate trainee"". 

7. This training period will go for al least another 4-5 years with exams as well. Then another year of training abroad.

8. There is very minimal cost to the government as post graduate trainees have on the job training. They don't sit in classrooms. They have to treat patients & learn at the same time during these 4-5 years. The cost to the government is only printing their student ID cards & the paper used to print notices / exam papers.

9. When going abroad for their final year of training consultants have to sign a bond.

10. So you have to work & study for at least  11-12  years or more to become a consultant 

11. Once you come back to Sri Lanka you are put into a new allocation list & there is a chance you will again be sent to a far off hospital with minimal facilities for another 4-5 years.

So there are no need for a bond or anything like that its just the economy. You will get a good degree , you will pay higher tax.

1oklnoh,,comment,"You couldn't be more wrong about Cuba. There are shortages of specialized doctors in Cuba, and it’s a direct consequence of how the country’s healthcare and education systems are structured. (Cuban health model is built around primary care and prevention, not specialization)

Cuba has one of the highest doctor-to-patients ratios (roughly 8-9 doctors / 1000 people, it's about 1-1.6 / 1000 in SL) but most of them are general practitioners or family physicians. Not specialists. Cuba has long wait times for specialised surgeries and diagnostic procedures. There's a drastic unequal distribution of doctors between cities and rural areas. There's also high dependence on referrals abroad to Venezuela or Mexico for the same. The plea by the Health Minister here is also for specialist doctors, not general practitioners. 

One of the primary factors causing this is the brain drain. The Cuban government themselves have admitted this and imposed travel restrictions on healthcare professionals. (This has been covered by Human Rights Watch) The ones that are even sent on missions abroad, the state collects most of their earnings and the doctors try and not return.

I'm sure the 65 year long complete embargo on trade with Cuba had nothing to do with the above issues, or the fact that their largest trade partner no longer existing since 1991 had no effect on their current material conditions. Specialist equipment and medicine grows on sugar cane trees -_-

But that's besides the point. I'm not a doctor nor does my field of expertise lie in medicine, so if a medical professional reads this they can correct me: 

My understanding is that preventative care and early diagnosis that is afforded by gps is the primary driver of patient wellbeing. It's easier to treat a condition that is caught early than it is to treat it when its been allowed to fester. This is not the case for everything I know, but it's probably true for a pretty big chunk of health conditions. Because I see no other way to explain the high lifespan and low infant mortality rate they have given everything else they endure. This is why I consider the cuban model to be superior. Yes there is a lack of specialists, but Cuba does not need as many specialists because medical conditions are caught and treated early which reduces the need for specialists.

>The Cuban government themselves have admitted this and imposed travel restrictions on healthcare professionals. (This has been covered by Human Rights Watch)

The fact that the Cuban government said it's a criminal offense for a doctor to neglect their duty of care during a pandemic, is something to be lauded lmao wtf.

As for the right to associate with people hostile to Cuba, I mean, what do you expect? They are living inside America's ass cheeks, the same country that firebombed them and tried and failed to invade them in the bay of pigs fiasco. And this rule was put in place during the first Trump term too. How naive should they be not to have a rule like that in place? Might as well roll out the red carpet for CIA goons at that point... 

But we are deviating from Cuba's medical policies into something else now. I believe I answered your question why I think cuba's model is superior for their material condition. Sri Lanka can take a similar approach, and given that we aren't being embargoed, can probably improve on that model too",-2,/r/srilanka/comments/1oklnoh/i_dont_think_they_will_come_back/nmcqjrj/,1761910652.0

​And for the statistical inclinations, below is a small part of the answer that I've got from Gemini. (You could've done this by yourself before making the comment)

​""Aggression: Meta-analyses (e.g., Archer, 2004) consistently show that males, on average, engage in more physical aggression than females. This difference is moderate to large and is observable from early childhood.
Risk-Taking: Males, on average, are statistically more inclined to take risks across multiple domains, including physical, financial, and social risks.
Empathy: The results here are nuanced. While ""empathy"" is complex, studies often find that females, on average, score higher on measures of affective empathy (feeling what another person is feeling) and social sensitivity.
Spatial Ability: Males, on average, tend to perform better on specific spatial tasks, particularly 3D mental rotation (the ability to imagine rotating an object in space).""",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1ojtxz7/does_anyone_else_get_annoyed_by_shit_like_this/nm5tjch/,1761815741.0

1oi30hx,,comment,"Let me tell you about Indians in Australia mate. While there are some of them legally migrated to the country paid taxes, educated their children and have become ideal citizens most of them nowadays are students and temporary visa holders entering the country. Students they sign up for some unknown university or college for some “IT degree” with the sole purpose of not studying but doing a job and earning. Even once their visa duration is over they still hand around in the country to make as much as money possible until they get caught to some illegal migration enforcement agency and forcibly get deported. Same with the temp visa holders as well. They enter the country to do a particular profession but end up doing all kinds of odd jobs and overstay their visa and be illegal aliens. I see this is happening in Sri Lanka as well. Unless the current government takes some drastic action to cull the Indian population in Sri Lanka very soon all of us will not have a country for ourselves. I sincerely hope for the betterment of we Sri Lankan’s and our children the government takes some stern action to get rid of this illegal Indians who have entered Sri Lanka.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1oi30hx/what_kind_of_visas_are_those_indians_in_sri_lanka/nluz6fe/,1761671664.0
1oi30hx,,comment,"Fuck no. Every single employee at Tim Horton's is a fucking Indian, it has thrown off their whole system. 

I bet the original proposal was to bring in the immigrants who work for piss poor wages to counterbalance this supposed ""sever shortage of labor"" over in Canada too. 

But it has pushed down the wage standards and distorted the whole labour market. Even in the trucking industry. Once wage depression sets in, it stays that way for generations. Wherever the Indians go, they scam the system and make that happen.

They're going to create long term infiltration if brought in for skilled jobs, no Indian should be given managerial or HR positions in a company, they only hire their own kind afterwards. Indian nepotism is disgusting in the tech industry in North America. No other minority has that practice, not Latin Americans, not Africans, not Philippinos, it's only them.

Do not even think about replacing the local labor force with those people, if Sri Lankans are being lazy and rather drive tuktuks, the reasons for that should be figured out and found solutions for. 

Do not import the Indians.",0,/r/srilanka/comments/1oi30hx/what_kind_of_visas_are_those_indians_in_sri_lanka/nly80z6/,1761708963.0

I looked it up real quick and found this:

“The Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) of Sri Lanka requires any foreign contractor doing ‘identified construction work’ to register with them under the Construction Industry Development Act No. 33 of 2014.”

Is the government actually issuing work permits for them? 🤢🤮 Because that’s diabolical if true. Their work quality is abysmal. I had the huge misfortune of working with two Indian mechanical engineers when I was in Colombo (they were brought in by the American company that built the US Embassy there), and neither of them even knew how to draft in AutoCAD.

Granted, their situation was different cause they were already embedded in the company and just got shipped around the region for projects.",0,/r/srilanka/comments/1oi30hx/what_kind_of_visas_are_those_indians_in_sri_lanka/nlvctnb/,1761675578.0

1oha8xg,,comment,"Malaria rlly was a big problem here from immemorial time, the worst recorded being from 1934-35, in which 1.5 million got infected with Malaria. This was when the population was still somewhere between 5-6 million, meaning that 1/5 to 1/4, got infected Malaria, which isn't a joke. How incapacitated would it be for anyone to do anything, thank goodness concerted efforts led to Malaria being 'eliminated' in 2016, with concerted efforts of Anti-Malaria Campaign, us now being in the prevention of re establishment phase.

It rlly was a whole century of progress. According to Anti-Malaria Campaign Website ;

1911: Organized malaria control activities commenced with the establishment of the Anti Malaria Campaign in Kurunegala.

1934-1935: A massive malaria epidemic occurred in Sri Lanka, causing widespread cases and deaths.

1946: Introduction of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), leading to a steady decline in malaria morbidity and mortality.

1958: The newly independent Government of Ceylon launched a malaria eradication program, aligned with WHO recommendations.

1963: Near eradication status was achieved, with only 17 reported cases (11 of which were imported).

1967-1969: A major setback occurred, culminating in a massive malaria epidemic.

1989: The program was transformed into a decentralized campaign, implemented by 9 provincial health authorities under the technical guidance of the National Anti Malaria Campaign Directorate.

2009: Sri Lanka embarked on a phased malaria pre-elimination program after the end of the separatist war.

2011: The malaria elimination program was launched.

October 2012: The last case of indigenous malaria was reported.

2016 (September 5): Sri Lanka was declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization.",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1oha8xg/sri_lankas_healthcare_system_is_one_of_the_good/nlrz3k7/,1761626955.0

1oeydya,,comment,"People in this sub often defend the treatment of elephants in this country claiming it's for religious or cultural purposes. Well, this is what the government and people of another Buddhist country which also gives Buddhism a special place in its constitution thinks of their treatment-an international embarrassment;


""The Thai government is set to hold talks with Sri Lanka on October 28 to bring back two elephants that were gifted by Thailand, following reports of poor living conditions and alleged mistreatment.


Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), Suchart Chomklin, wrote on his Facebook page yesterday, October 23, that he plans to fly urgently to Sri Lanka amid growing concerns about the welfare of the two Thai elephants, Plai Pratu Pha and Plai Srinarong.


Concerns were first raised last year by the Reclaim Thai Elephant group. The group’s coordinator, Yuwanuch Kiattiwong, together with 50 members, visited the MONRE to submit an official letter urging the government to take action over the elephants’ poor living conditions.


According to the group, the elephants, which were originally gifted by Thailand, have been forced to work excessively and deprived of proper welfare standards. The animals were reportedly kept in chains at all times and beaten. The group called for their immediate return to Thailand to ensure a better quality of life.""",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1oeydya/thai_government_moves_to_bring_back_2_gifted/nl4yi2s/,1761314217.0

juj2j1,,comment,"Her skin is whitened because it is more likely with our colonial history that a fairer girl would be exposed to Lo-Fi Hip Hop. 

The fairness also contrasts well with her androgynous dress sense. I am guessing someone who likes Lo-Fi is also not very exuberant in their dress sense. 

She is obviously burgher whose families socio-economic status has fallen with successive entitled attitudes by the paternal figure of each generation. 

Judging by her cultural choices, phone, and proximity to a bus stop she is probably from the Colombo suburbs and probably went to a third wave international school. She has cousins who are in Australia.

An institution isn't a building it is the people. In which country does a president comes back as an MP and become the Prime Minister again. Our presidents like beggars are asking aid from other countries, closing down well functioning national institutions for their underhand deals.

This is mainly because Sri Lankans allow ""ask no questions, respect the elected"" political culture. These people are nothing, they are elected by the public, spending our money.

I live in Canada btw, you will be surprised, people here dont give a shit about the elected, you can just give a call to your MP and they will assign a case number and officer to look in to your concern.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""plenty"" I've lived 28 years in Sri Lanka and all I've known was struggle (when compared to how I'm living now). Just take a look at our public transport and we had the first tram system in Asia once upon a time.

This is why it’s best to leave the rescuing to a lifeguard. 

If you’re not a lifeguard, some advice I’ve seen online multiple times is to **approach the drowning person from behind and hold them in a way where you have full control of their limbs.**

1ip5p3q,,comment,"I've done this a few times. But tge nost memorable one was when my sister and I was swimming in a river. A small ones when she suddenly just jump in where the water is deep. She thought it was fine since I went through it fine. Not knowing that I swam through it. 

And then as I hear the splash, I lookedback and saw here flailing around in the water. Quickly swam to her and from under water trying to lift her. 

As she panicked she pushed me even further in. At this point we both almost drown. As Islowly lose my breath, I made the decision to push her above water for a breather before I pull her back in for my turn to take a deep breath before pushing her to the side from under the water. 

When we got to the shallow side, I could see adults around us panicking and was half way in the water. 

At that moment I didn't know that it was serious. Now that I looked back. It is important for you to not get pulled in as you're saving a drowning person.

1ip5p3q,,comment,"I'm a SCUBA rescue diver, OWSI etc... a drowning person would touch the bottom and kick up eventually, and 10000% a drowning person would have dragged her down and climbed on her head practically to get out of the water. The fact that she is filming and their friend is behind drowning nobody else helping in fact nobody says anything in a panic until she asks what is going on, then she lowers the camera while the drowning guy pretends to be rescued by her with one arm. I've saved a drowning Japanese scuba diver in Thailand while teaching, it took two of us to calm him down and hold his head up out of the water, and I was wearing a fully inflated BCD. Anyone that has actually tried to help a drowning person will know you can't do it with one arm and you need to be prepared to get pulled down. In fact yhere is almost no point trying to save a drowning person without some sort of flotation device.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1ip5p3q/dude_owes_this_woman_both_his_kidneys_his_liver/mcvgk7p/,1739608144.0

1ghxef2,,comment,"Translation - So basically this guy has managed to invent a way to make drink straws 🥤🧃from coconut leaves 🌴🥥🌿 that would normally be discarded as waste after making Sweeper Brooms 🧹 (Idall in Sinhala). He has also invented a rapid Sweeper Broom machine among many other machines that has won him many medals 🥇.

Although he lost a leg serving his country, he remains a hero dedicated to its progress. He is an innovator, creating new machines for various products. His latest invention is a coconut leaf straw as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic straws.

Currently it is illegal to import or sell plastic straws in Sri Lanka to prevent single-use plastic garbage and microplastics into food 🙅🏻🙂‍↔️.

Unfortunately I can't remember what they said exactly, but it really shows that our ancestors didn't eat with their hands for fun, but there was a valid thought process behind it.

Also, I dunno why some Whites are grossed out by it, because do they not know the existence of hygiene and how we used to be trained since childhood to wash our fingers before we touch our food? And to think they think nothing about walking around with crusted E.coli hanging about their ass shocks me XD.

1lpjj00,,comment,"I'm from Barcelona where you can still find bidets in older houses (and older generations still use them) but never in public places. I have never used one. This is why I want to ask —from ignorance— why bidet is better than toilet paper.Because there are a couple things I don't like from what I think using a bidet means:

* In public places, you need to hold a shower head close to your butt that is touched by many hands. You don't know if the people before you held it with dirty hands, or if they brought it too close to their butt and there could be poo on it. With toilet paper, you know you're the first one to touch that piece of paper (because it's white and you could clearly see if there was a stain on it.
* Once you're done cleaning your butt, which is now wet, how do you get it dry? The ways I can think are:
   * You just put your pants back on and wet your pants.
   * You use a communal towel which sounds antihygienic
   * You use toilet paper to dry it but in my country toilet paper breaks easily if it gets into contact with water so is your paper stronger? And also, a lot of comments here are talking about the toilet paper industry but it seems to me you must also use toilet paper to dry your butts?

This is how I imagine using bidets and why I don't find it that much better, apart from the fact that you clean your butt better, but I would love for you to tell me why you think it is better and answer my doubts, thanks!",-4,/r/srilanka/comments/1lpjj00/never_understood_why_a_lot_of_foreign_countries/n0xa4sw/,1751455491.0

1lpjj00,,comment,"Genuine question: Do you really feel clean after wiping your ass with papers? 

I have see people going from tp to bidet but rarely the other way around. I have heard of how some people who vacationed in Sri Lanka (in Asia for that matter), got so used to bidets and cleanliness they felt after using bidets went on to get them for themselves.

To answer your questions,

1. It's a simple matter of cleaning or disinfecting your hands after handling it. I can see why you be terrified to imagine using something that's been too close to their butts which also might have touch their poos, one thing I'm sure of is as long time bidet users, we don't touch poo with the bidets. I mean we have done it our whole lives and we know how to use it properly. So I don't really face that dilemma when I'm in a public bathroom. 

And for me one plus point of having a bidet at a public bathroom is, I can use it to clean the toilet before using it. Have you ever had to sit down on a toilet seat which you can clearly see someone's piss? Would you rather wipe that off with paper and sit on it or have it washed?

2. We usually just pull our pants back on, It never really wet your pants as you think. Never have bothered me. However for me after moving to Canada, since there's always tp present, I would use them to dry myself.

And since you asked about using bidet that's been touched by others, what are your thoughts about pressing the button to flush the toilet (Unless it's touchless of course) that you know hundreds of people have literally just wiped their asses and touched?",16,/r/srilanka/comments/1lpjj00/never_understood_why_a_lot_of_foreign_countries/n0xil2w/,1751458908.0
1lpjj00,,comment,"Let me ask just one question,
 If someone has a problem using a bidet in a public restroom because of others handling it, don't they also have a problem sitting on a toilet seat that numerous other people have already used?
And as a daily bidet/ water user, I can confidently say that a little wetness in the crack ain't a big deal or discomfort as many imagine it to be. The bidet isn't a water jet.",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1lpjj00/never_understood_why_a_lot_of_foreign_countries/n13bsdg/,1751530580.0

1nr7lw1,,comment,"This can be looked at in many perspectives. We all know Sri Lanka is highly obliged to China since they’ve given us loans worth billions over the years. At the same time, both China and India are economic revivals, and our location in the Indian ocean has always been very important throughout history, so India can’t just let China have full control over us. We also have to understand that, unlike countries like Japan most others tend to help us with their own agendas back of the mind. Further India’s stand during the LTTE war, and the things we still hear from Indian politicians (especially in Tamil Nadu) are examples that raise concerns.

To say it short, everything depends on the perspective you look at it. Help during hard times is still help, and it should be appreciated. But when a country helps another while its own people don’t even have their basic needs met there’s usually more behind it than what we see on the outside.

1nr7lw1,,comment,"Hey, my guy, you seem to be a very nice bloke. So I'll put it in the best way possible. You ask why Sri lankans hate indians. Several people have explained why most Sri Lankans don't like or act hostile toward India as a state. Due to war, political intervention, and the long and violent history (before the current two names of India and Sri Lanka existed).

 I'll clarify why Sri Lankans don't like or 'hate' Indians as a people. This mostly comes from Sri lankans who travel internationally. The main reason is how most indians conduct themselves wherever they go. I don't have to explain here what it is that indians do that irritates so many people. Sri Lankans on the other hand, don't do this type of thing that impacts negatively on our people. But unfortunately, whenever we travel abroad, it is very common for Sri Lankans to face racism from the locals of that country (not just the west, in the whole Asian region as well) not because we are brown but because they think we are Indian. No one likes to be treated poorly because of someone else's actions. I know you understand that. 

I travel a lot and have experienced this firsthand several times. And also seen the change of attitude of the other person when I say Im Sri Lankan as well. Indian fatigue in the West didn't come out of nothing it came from the things Indian immigrants do. I can go on and on about this, but not gonna. I just wanted to explain to you why the hate and dislike and I think I did it. 

What do you think? Do you think it is fair or right for Sri Lankans to feel ot act that way?",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1nr7lw1/ill_always_respect_india_for_this/ngm9djd/,1759047848.0

1nr7lw1,,comment,"IMO, few reasons for negative attitudes are

- India’s role in the LTTE war would be the main thing
- Indians committing crimes in Western countries, so sri lankans try to differentiate themselves (dont get me wrong. What I mean is since india has a big population and cultural influence, people easily note them)

- Extreme negatives in indian culture like Dowry deaths, extreme Caste discrimination, which are  very low in Sri Lanka

- There was an agreement to be signed with India in 2018 (ETCA) which will make Indians in IT and health sector to work in Sri Lanka. So people might think we’ll loose our jobs and people are now on the lookout. Cant remember exact details though.

- The media Channels in SL show some really horrible low budget indian dramas here, which killed the SL drama industry. (Used to show good ones in Government channels like Malgudi days, but not anymore)


Again, I think its the size of India and population that act as catalyst, making it easily noticeable, despite there are countries waaaaay dangerous.

That 16 hour power cuts was the final nail in the coffin, people started protesting and president resigned and rest is history.

About the second part of your question. It’s not a straight forward answer. India is a large country, the size we Sri Lankans can’t even comprehend. And every country has bad apples. But because of your sheer size those bad apples are not small in number. Everyone formulate their opinions based on their own experiences (if not and let’s say you borrow your opinion from others like social media, then you’re an idiot, you don’t have to care about the opinion of those people anyway). My opinion about indians is good, because my interactions for the most part have been pleasant. But some not so pleasant interactions made me realize that certain stereotypes are there for a reason and i hate my self for thinking like that. 
We look at india more like a sibling with whom we have a love/ hate relationship.

The question should be why does Sri Lanka need aid? And if you need aid, then don't criticise the aid givers for having agendas. Nobody owes anything to Sri Lanka. For decades got free money thanks to the war and once that finished (should be a good thing), things got financially worse. 

Beggars can't be choosers. Just because the crisis is over doesn't mean it can't happen again. Sri Lanka is the only country that has ever taken a loan from Bangladesh for god's sake. That is how pathetic the situation was. So maybe that is why they think they owe respect. India is a terrible country to owe anything to.

The GOI made a simple judgement after seeing the state of collapse. But still would say that the benefit to Sri Lanka is greater than the cost of such an assistance.

Nobody wants you to worship the NDA government in India. But as someone who visits this subreddit, the irrational phobia of India is pretty mind boggling. All the current state of frictions could easily be taken care off if Sri Lanka puts its past behind and treat the Tamils as their own citizens. The recent mass graves and many accusations of land encroachment does not instill much confidence. India gets drawn because people forget that Tamil people are a fundamental part of our country. The community has contributed in terms of army generals, diplomats ministers, scientists, presidents etc. Our current foreign minister is a Tamil and his father was a great man who shaped our strategic doctrines. Dr Radhakrishnan and Dr Kalam individually  are both considered one of the greatest Indians to have graced our country. Both contributed to the country and gave the symbolic leadership that the country needed. They were both Tamils.

India even has got out of her way in recent times to help Sri Lankan government to rehabilitate displaced Tamil people in the North by granting assistance to build housing for them etc. But the distrust which one can understand as a legacy of Mrs and Mr Gandhi's decision to back the LTTE should not be isolated in one prism. All of this was preceded by Mr Jaywardhane and his anti Tamil policies.  I do not want to get into the past. But sometimes aid is just an aid for the interest of stability (is it too much to ask) and at the end of the day a Sri Lanka on the verge of collapse do not help anyone.

Nevertheless, there are cases of Sri Lankans ON THIS SUBREDDIT admitting about the lack of ""civic sense"" amongst Sri Lankans abroad:

https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/s/ciALlAqihP

Whenever relations between Indian and (insert neighbouring South Asian country) are discussed, there are statements  amongst the people of that said neighbouring country that ""Indians have poor civic sense"". However, in posts that aren't focused on relations between Indian and (insert neighbouring South Asian country), you will find civic sense issues that are eerily similar to what Indians supposedly do en masse aboard.

Of course, whenever I counter implications that this isn't some India-specific thing and it's largely a South Asian thing, people start to ""bargain"" saying ""no no Pakistanis aren't that bad... I have seen many people of all nationalities prematurely in the plane before it lands"". Yeah... sure. 

The reason why Westerners use ""Indian"" to refer to South Asians as a whole isn't usually because they beileve that ""civic sense"" issues are limited to  Indians. It's because India is the largest country in South Asia population wise and geographically and also most known. It's like most people wouldn't really know of Kuwait or Bahrain but will know of UAE and use that to reference the entire Arabian Gulf (I was born in the Arabian Gulf) and extend all stereotypes of the UAE to the entire Gulf.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1nr7lw1/ill_always_respect_india_for_this/njexbj3/,1760429152.0

Again what you feel & how you feel about India & Indians is upto you, I don't mean to be rude, but we won't be doing anything anytime soon to change your feelings you have for us, the token gestures of bailouts & evacuating your citizens will continue despite of those, those acts just give us more leverage, India already has neighbors who despise it, are we bothered by it, I personally don't think so, it's not chasing validation, a country can't function if it has to satisfy it's neighbors.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1nr7lw1/ill_always_respect_india_for_this/ngiepsw/,1758993671.0

Fending for ourselves? It wasn’t us who were cornered. It was the Tigers who were fighting for survival on the brink of defeat. We, on the other hand, were doing fine,  a liberalised economy, foreign investment pouring in, and the country moving forward. and thats where india stepped in.

>""are there any consequences for breaking it??""

yes. the choice we had was;

1. the indo-lanka accord and IPKF intervention.
2. get full on invaded by india.

That was the ultimatum we got, the explicit threat from the Indian government. India was, by any objective measure, the antagonist. The Indo-Lanka Accord cut so deep it forced us to rewrite our own constitution, a change that still divides Sri Lankans today. You don’t need to think too hard to see how absurdly unfair the situation was. Imagine China arming terrorists in your country, then imposing a treaty that rewrites your constitution and fractures your population. **Would you still reduce it to “geopolitics” if it was your country being victimised?**

>""a country can't function if it has to satisfy it's neighbors.""

thank you for accepting this one fact. **so we can agree that Sri Lanka can't function if it has to satisfy indian geopolitical interests?** so its perfectly fine if we cosy up to china and Pakistan yes?

I seem to remember you saying ""is it too much to ask not to fraternize with our enemies?""  which is an implicit request on Sri Lanka to satisfy its neighbour. **hypocrite.**",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1nr7lw1/ill_always_respect_india_for_this/ngioiyy/,1758996668.0

I’m simply tightening your logic.

You say *“is it too much to ask to not fraternize with our enemies,”* which demands Sri Lanka placate an Indian interest. Then you say *“a country can’t function if it has to satisfy its neighbors,”* which excuses India for trampling Sri Lankan interests.

You can’t hold both positions. That’s a double standard. Either you think every state has the right to defend its sovereignty, or you accept that stronger neighbors can impose their will. But you can’t change the rule depending on whether it’s India or Sri Lanka. **Right now, your stance amounts to “rules for thee but not for me.”** I know geopolitics is unfair, but your logic is inconsistent: when Sri Lanka resists India, you say we should fall in line; when India violates our sovereignty, you dismiss it as “just geopolitics.” You can’t have it both ways.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1nr7lw1/ill_always_respect_india_for_this/ngiwb1l/,1758999138.0

Incorrect, You can't, but I can, I get to act like a Hypocritical Asshole by virtue of being the bigger stronger neighbor.

Heck yeah It is, I'm self aware.

>>Either you think every state has the right to defend its sovereignty, or you accept that stronger neighbors can impose their will. 

Every ""Strong"" state with a decent sized military with a big enough war chest or Nukes has the right and can defend it's sovereignty, otherwise you just exist out of the Benelovence of its stronger neighbors.
An exception: If a small country enjoys the patronage or largesse of a Superpower like Israel.


Unfortunately for Sri Lanka it possess neither of the above.


>>But you can’t change the rule depending on whether it’s India or Sri Lanka. 

Oh But I can, stronger countries bully their weaker neighbors all the time

>>I know geopolitics is unfair, 

Always has been.



>>but your logic is inconsistent

From the Lankan perspective yes, but that's the thing the Indian dispensation can be apathetic to this, why would we want to cajole when we can leverage you, that's easier.


>>when Sri Lanka resists India, you say we should fall in line; when India violates  our sovereignty, you dismiss it as “just geopolitics.” You can’t have it both ways.

We've been having it both ways for a while now.


I say this with no malice, I am sure a majority of Indians harbor no ill will towards Lankans & Sri Lanka, you're lovely people and as Buddhist I would loved to visit Sri Lanka someday, but if you think you're at liberty to make Foreign Policy decisions pertaining to the Indo Pacific region, you're mistaken.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1nr7lw1/ill_always_respect_india_for_this/ngjdhjq/,1759004583.0
1nr7lw1,,comment,">“I get to act like a Hypocritical Asshole by virtue of being the bigger stronger neighbor.”

Admitting hypocrisy does not make Indian atrocities justifiable. You are not a prime minister, not a military leader, not a policymaker. You are a powerless citizen rationalizing mass murder and war crimes in the abstract language of vague national power and foreign policy.

In 1987, your state murdered thousands of Tamil civilians and prolonged the war by 22 years through funding and arming militants. **I nearly died in the Nolimit suicide bombing**. **I lost a grandfather and an uncle in combat, and another uncle and an aunt in the 1996 Central Bank suicide bombing.** These lives were stolen by India’s intervention, yet you intellectualize it as *“might makes right.”* **That detachment is inhuman.**

At the level of state behavior, I can perfectly understand India’s actions on the basis of ruthless geopolitics. At the level of the individual, I struggle to understand why YOU  aren't  ashamed of your country's actions, you ought to be, Instead, you dismiss mass death (which your taxes were probably responsible for) with a smirk and say “heck yeah I’m a hypocrite.”

I believe many of us Sri lankans struggle on this one, I think the reason is they truly believe that what they did was good. I've listened to several podcasts done in English with Indian military veterans in IPKF, and they truly 100% believe that Sri lankan Government asked for their help to control the LTTE and is genuinely surprised on how we did not want them there. It was just so weird for me to listen to. The person who is debating you on this sub has explicitly shown that India, as a big neighbor, can bully its smaller neighbors all they want even though he started the conversation in a totally different manner. In my personal opinion, Sri Ianka can not come out of the current situation alone and must have a nation we can rely upon, a 3rd world nation must not rely on another 3rd world nation to become a better nation. That would get us nowhere. We should lean more on nations like Japan, China, or the United States. This means we have to pick a side. India is properly countering this by preventing Sri Lankan Military by obtaining proper equipment to defend ourselves in case of hostilies break out.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1nr7lw1/ill_always_respect_india_for_this/ngmd0v8/,1759050036.0

If India is truly confident in its regional standing, it wouldn’t need to belittle smaller neighbors or reduce every historical grievance to “might makes right.” Strong nations earn respect not just through power, but through restraint, accountability, and the ability to listen.

By your own admission, India acted hypocritically in Sri Lanka, but instead of reflecting on it, you brush it off as if morality is irrelevant in geopolitics. That’s not strength — it’s apathy disguised as realism. And apathy is why India, despite its size, still struggles to command genuine goodwill among its neighbors.

You may see Sri Lanka as “small nation energy, ""but Sri Lanka has something India clearly struggles with: the willingness of many Sri Lankans to acknowledge past wrongs, including the atrocities committed against Tamils, instead of excusing them as geopolitics.

I'm happy to see that SLs parliament doesn't have a nepo baby party heading it but there are still 100+ things the ruling govt isn't doing nor have they made clear plans on how they're going to a) address corruption, b) address SOE reform (since our public sector is still failing), c) arresting Rajapaksa bros (SC already ruled them guilty), d) de-militarizing the North etc. etc.

We need clear dates and plans, when you sign up for a job your boss doesn't celebrate, and if you don't reach KPIs you're fired, the same should apply to NPP or any party in power.

The govt are public servants, treat them like that, being better than fucking Namal is not an achievement. For all SJB supporters, do your duty and get Harsha to kick out Sajith already lol.

This is Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Who is neither from UNP or SLFP, which are the 2 main parties of Sri Lanka.  [Anura Kumara Dissanayake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anura_Kumara_Dissanayake)

In 2019 pres. election he had only 3% of votes, this time he gained 42%.

and they only had 3 seats out of 225 seats in the parliment since 2020-2024. But today they secured 159 for themselves crusing old guard corrupt rotting political dynasites to the gound. [Parlimentary Election 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Sri_Lankan_parliamentary_election)

1gro9o8,,comment,"The Easter Sunday attack was perfectly laid and excecuted plan by Rajapaksas to gain power after their crushing defeat in 2015. Which labled the most powerful Mahinda Rajapaksa as a ""Thief"". From 2015 onwards they tried to do great many things to grab the power. They spreaded a fake news about an Assasination attempt on then president Sirisesa ochestrated by then PM Ranil. That clown fell for it and gave the PM post to Mahinda removing Ranil. However it was a violation againt constitution. [Rajapaksa Coup in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Sri_Lankan_constitutional_crisis)

After that the rumor of assasination attempted vanished. Then suddently Easter Sunday happened.

Supricingly Rajapaksa's wife, a chirstian devottee hadnt gone to church that day. So we most of Christian MPs and their family memebers who usually do. Also India has informed MPs of Sri Lanka about the attack. But nobody told the public.

Guess who were at the Kochchikade church minutes after the explosion? The saviour of the country, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Guess who he said would tuckle so called terrorism? The Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Guess who they introduced for the 2019 presidential election as a candidate? Guess what were their election promises. Those everything circled around them and the attack.

And most importantly, when they get the power first thing they did was to dismantale the intelligance servies and then hide every information regarding the attack. To this day from 2019.04.21 we still dont know who did it. Because no govenment officially disclosed it or investigate it.

Believe me, WE KNOW.

  
Rajapaksas did it. They targeted christians to becasue they could easily use already growing anti-muslim tension as well as get the support from both sinhalese and tamils. It went well for them. They got nearly 2/3 seats in parliment as well as execative presidency.

1gro9o8,,comment,"A lot of people believe that the then govt. and the Rajapaksas were involved in it. I personally don't think they specifically targeted churches themselves, it was an islamist terrorist cell that targeted. The govt. is accused of having intelligence reports about such an attack being planned and yet doing nothing to prevent it and there's speculation the Rajapaksas let these cell grow during their previous govt. Btw so far none of this has been proven, and despite being 5 years the previous govts. have delayed investigations or come into any conclusion on who was behind the attacks.

From around 2013 right up until the 2019 elections there was a rising tide of anti-Islamic rhetoric being spread by certain parties which had led to a number of anti-muslim riots in certain areas and them being portrayed as a threat. The bombing on the churches was seen by many as the climax to it which lead to the massive victory of the Rajapaksas whose main promise was to battle this threat and bring back security to the country. 

After the victory there was no more fear mongering and the so called threat that they portrayed seemed to disappear, which lead many people to believe it was the work of politicians all along just to create tensions to gain votes. (Prior to 2009 the tamils were shown as the threat to garner votes and they seemed to need a new threat on racial basis which they turned on to the muslims). This election in 2024 marked a departure from that after many decades where there was no talk about racial issues among any candidates but only about the development of the economy.",0,/r/srilanka/comments/1gro9o8/he_who_united_the_whole_country_under_one_umbrella/lxe5xtg/,1731736558.0

This is exactly what I mean. don't set the bar so low. I'm demanding the bare minimum lol. The govt are public servants long overdue on making progress, celebrating them doing the bare minimum opens the gates to making them lazy, as we can see right now. Also people were saying the exact same shit about Maithri's election, he too didn't use religious slogans and was glazed for barely being progressive

Again, don't count eggs until they hatch. Just because SL has been backwards for so long that not blowing up a church is something to celebrate doesn't mean we shouldn't point out how ridiculous that is in the first place. To call this a joyous occasion says a lot about the mentality regarding politics and progress here, this guy has done nothing, celebrate your own voting if anything, also its not true, NPP propaganda was very much a thing, I heard it in my streets myself, the whole fucking day they blasted bullshit on their speakers

Because still there are people who worship Rajapaksas. Dude you won't believe what some people are saying. You should visit some rural areas (like my father's hometown, no my father's home-village, is that a word?) and ask from those people ""who can barely afford their kids meals"". They still believe that this whole thing is because covid and only one who can rescue us is Mahinda. 

Not even those rural people, once I argued with a cousin of a friend of mine, well educated guy. But thinks this all happened because Russia-Ukrain war. LOL. He's saying Rajapaksas have to wait until the end of war, then all things be fine.

I mean the mentality of these people. I can understand If they have any political or financial gains. But no, they are literally worshipping Rajapaksas. That's why I said it. I do not wish it but there  need to be some sort of big impact to change some people's minds. Just wait for the next election, there definitely will be some significant amount of people who vote for Rajapaksas.",4,/r/srilanka/comments/uketjy/sri_lankan_and_proud/i7t9kwy/,1652027181.0

uketjy,,comment,">Neither of them stole at such a large scale

I can't honestly believe people compare the rajapakshas and anyone else lol.

The rajapakshas have their own rank with no equal. Its ridiculous how much they've ruined and continue to ruin the country. 

The literal personification of greed. Even when we got a 1bn loan for essential they imported ""essential infrastructure material"" for 500mn and only 300mn was kept for essential imports.

The level of greed is worse than any other govt that ever came to power. 

The only comparison I can think of would be the British when we were colonised and they looted our country for all our natural resources. 

And a good corporation that resembles the rajapakshas would be the East India trading company (look them up and you'll understand why they reflect the rajapakshas)",8,/r/srilanka/comments/uketjy/sri_lankan_and_proud/i7rbv6y/,1651982214.0

1mkz2ov,,comment,">It doesn’t

in my opinion it objectively fixes quite a few issues

one of the main issues with r/eelam was the moderation team who were working overtime to produce resources and organise them to spread their ideas effectively. books, thesis, documentaries, essays. imagine the countless numbers of people who weren't educated on the conflict receiving THAT version of history. r/eelam being wiped solves that issue. anyone who is curious about this conflict are much more likely to visit r/eelamwarcrimes, or r/srilanka. id rather have them in these subs than that hate-filled echo-chamber.

secondly. r/eelam being gone objectively proves something. they broke rule number 1, and went wayyy too far. and this opinion is coming from reddit, in the form their group being banned, not some sinhalese person on twitter, or state propaganda. this objectively shows a flaw In their movement, that it is not compatible with modern social standards.

rule number 1 is 

""Rule 1

Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence.

I can identify as ""hela"" even today cause its the same thing as sinhalese.it has nothing to do with an identity, its just a name.If it is we cant even identify as sinhalese anymore cause our identity completely differentiated from the people back in 4th century, so it isnt about an identity.there wasnt a sudden and complete identity transition to become sinhala and elu as two different things

1mkz2ov,,comment,"Mandela didn’t fight for a separate state for colored people even when they were facing much worse racial discrimination. We didn’t have an apartheid like that. Even during the war tamil people used to live everywhere. There were no tamil only areas, busses, shops, entrance etc. (im not saying there was no racism at all cuz there obviously was). So your question doesn’t make sense. Fighting for rights is different from fighting for separation. 

World is a horrible place but it would be worse if everyone wanted more division. Worse places in earth are the places that promote division (ex N. korea, Israel, kashmir, hell even US ever since Trump).

1mkz2ov,,comment,"Mandela’s fight was in a country with many ethnic groups spread everywhere, so separation wasn’t realistic and his goal was equality within one nation. 

In Sri Lanka the Tamil population was mostly in the North and East and for decades they faced violent crackdowns on peaceful protests, were excluded from politics and jobs and even had their historical records destroyed. This wasn’t just about not having “Singhalese only buses”, it was systemic oppression in their own regions. 
When a group is concentrated in one area and all peaceful efforts fail, the push for their own state becomes a lot stronger. Very different situation from South Africa.",-1,/r/srilanka/comments/1mkz2ov/reddit_admins_have_finally_woken_up/n7y87uf/,1754838333.0
1mkz2ov,,comment,It wasn’t about this ethnicity or that ethnicity. It was colored and white. And they chose to fight for rights instead of land. All the issues you mentioned happened in south Africa too. You don’t have to make it complex. Separation is never an option. And separation won’t bring peace.

A police investigation was launched over a video circulating on social media of a man brutally assaulting a 4-year-old child while he was eating at home.

The suspect, identified as Kukul Chaminda alias Bibile Chaminda, is a resident of Sampathanuwara in Padaviya.

A neighbour had recorded a video which was released on social media, of the particular suspect brutally assaulting the child while he was eating at his home.

According to information the suspect had assaulted this child on several previous occasions as well, but nobody had informed the police in fear of him.

Meanwhile, a group of officers, including the Sampathanuwara police station OIC, had raided the house. The suspect had fled the house, and police are conducting a search operation to locate him.

1d7peqn,,comment,"Based on the conversation if accurate in the way I heard it, there are a few points:

1. The kid is adopted. (That woman in blue blouse tells ”එයාට ඕන හින්දනෙ ගෙනල්ල තියෙන්නේ. එයාට ඕන විදිහට හදාගන්න.”\[Translation: He bought the kid because he wanted to. Let him discipline it the way he wants to”. the apathetic behavior of all the women in video towards the child confirms that he doesn‘t belong to any one of them.)
2. The kid has conducted a misdemeanor like stealing something. ( the man shouts “හොරා කාපන් බලන්න අම්මට හු@…” ). He tries to discipline the kid in worst way possible.
3. The guy who records this video although doesn’t have the strength himself to stand up against the abuse towards little kid, he threatens the man that He’ll definitely show this video to the police.

The second category is more nuanced than the ""we were civilized until the British left us alone"" crowd makes it seem.

 Although the Brits pillaged this country, we still maintained our cultural heritage through it all. Yet Sri Lankan nationalists had to compensate, and with the power of their small-dick syndrome, tried to cannibalize the minorities that helped them gain independence.

People act like the Brits razed this country to the ground. As if Sri Lanka couldn't have picked up the pieces and built something greater.

Almost the equivalent of King Cyrus freeing and repatriating the Jewish slaves back to Israel.
It's a historical one off scenario that almost NEVER happens in history.

They also left roads, trains, infrastructures, international trade relationships that did not exist prior, colleges and modern technology etc
For over 100 years there were next to no violent uprisings or genocides, save the small Matale rebellion which was not successful and only the perpetrators were imprisoned or killed.
It was remarkably peaceful rule.
That's a very very rare thing.

I don't support British colonialism.
But there was no ethnic cleansing, brutal regime or widespread disaster famine in Sri Lanka like there was in Ireland, India or Australia.
Why we internalise their problems as if we are them is a mistake.

Sri lankans need to get it through their head they were handed a very good deal and they were doing very well until recently with one of the finest human development indexes in Asia.
An educated populace, beautiful heritage sites, a tropical paradise full of animals, cocktails and great food, good international standing, booming tourism, famous agriculture sector and access to work visas overseas.

I don’t know about Sri Lanka, but in the case of India, their GDP per capita was only half that of the UK at the beginning of colonisation (so pretty good, since the UK was the most industrialised country on earth at that point), but when India gained independence in 1947, their GDP per capita was like 1/100th that of the UK.

International trade relationships? Dude, we had a self-sustained agriculture, which the British systematically crippled and made us dependent on imports. Not to mention we were already a major hub in the silk road. We didn't need colonizers to establish international trade relationships for us.

>But they created their own problems with all the racism

Please tell me you are at least aware of the policies of the colonization period that led to ""all the racism"". The British created the divide and let it fester, which allowed the local politicians to exploit it and make it into to a full-blown war. Yes there was racism before, but this is the country that provided refuge to Muslims when the Portuguese (Catholics) were persecuting them, and then provided refuge to the Catholics when the Dutch (Protestants) started persecuting them.

xan5p9,,comment,"Let me explain. And no I don't suffer from Stockholm Syndrome.

It will be a very small part of the book I am writing about Medieval Sri Lanka, the fall of the Cholan Empire and the rise of the Kingdom of Kandy.

I just try to look at things observationally and I try not to take the past personally.

I think Sri Lanka would have done fine without British Influence. But they would likely be in a disadvantaged position in a few areas for much longer.

The question really is simple.

Did the British leave Sri Lanka with more universities, a more literate population, a bigger middle class, involved them more heavily in world trade, provide exposure to modern technology such as electricity, scientific knowledge and infrastructure. The answer is YES.

Self sufficiency is fine. But all modern economies need to combine both.

Cash crops and mass production bring in more money.

They will always be prioritised by any developing or developed country than a small trade and barter economy.

And when the new government took over in 1948, they inherited those structures. That is a GOOD inheritance and gave Sri Lanka the same advantage that Singapore had in the 20th century. A country more modern than most of its neighbours and peers.

I'm really happy you know about the Muslim/Catholic Refugees of the 18th century. Sri Lanka was almost always at least 2 or 3 separate kingdoms at any one time. There was on and off war between the Tamil Arya Chakravarti of Jaffna and Singhalese Kings of Kotte. But there was also on and off trade and peace. There was likewise a lot of conflict between the Kingdom of Kotte and Kandy, both Singhalese anyway. Point is the country always struggled with unity. Most countries do. This is normal. Just look at  medieval Scotland and England etc or Egypt and Sudan. Very normal.

But regarding the divide and rule strategy, it was not a legal policy. Just a practice. of employing the most educated. The Jaffna Tamils had better universities. OFC It lead to public resentment. 50% of educated jobs were held by Tamils who were about 20-30%% of the population. That's not fair, but at that point, it was still peaceful and fixable.

The Singhalese Colombo elites were still the wealthiest and most educated. By 1948 the education gap could have been FIXED then and there with time, effort, patience, forgiveness and planning.  Reconciliation is always the first act of nation building.

The British allowed free elections in 1948. The Singhalese majority still formed the majority government and held the power to make the changes necessary to improve the lives of both Tamils and Singhalese. There was a chance there to make things BETTER. But Bandaranaike decided to allow the mobs of protestors to kill hundred to thousands of innocent Tamils in the streets for DECADES to grow his own power. Divide and rule was unjust, but it could have been fixed.

But Discriminate and Kill is always worse, and totally unacceptable.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/xan5p9/rajapaksa_simps_and_british_simps_ironically_have/io3nvhj/,1662973276.0

I mean, what makes you think that with time, like other countries that weren't colonized by the British, we would not be able to achieve these things on our own? It was about 150 years of colonization. What could've happened during that time is a big ""what-if"". The whole world evolved during that time. Do you think if we weren't under British rule, we would still be the way we were in the pre-colonization period?

They may have worsened under British influence, but they were all ready violent and there was a history of bloodshed before and long after the British were there.

European Jews were coming in large numbers by 1882/3 during the Ottoman period. 
More than 40 years prior to the British rule of Palestine.

They were not well received at all by the locals at any time.
Ethnic divide between Jews and Arabs created to parralel societies.

In fact there were so many riots, massacres and attacks on Jewish settlements by Palestinians Arabs in the 1910s the Jews formed a paramilitary defence force called the Harshomer for the sole purpose of stopping Arab insurgents from killing them.

Things got worse in the 1930s and 1940s in the  Holocaust because millions of Jews left Europe for Palestine, leading to a full scale war once the British army  left in 1947/48.

The India and Pakistan conflict predates anything the before and existed long after the British.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_India
Have a look at the list of massacres in the  1600s-1700s, 50 to 100 years before the British established themselves firmly in India.
And you will read all about how the Mughals, Sikhs, Marathas and Northern Tribals/ ""Afghans"" from modern Pakistan massacred each other in the 1000s to 400 000+  numbers killed. It was not peaceful when the British arrived. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_India

The British rule in India was cruel and unjust.
Borderline evil in many cases.
But don't forget the British only controlled 60% of the Indian population, the other 40% was run by the locals Rajas.
These local Rajas were just as violent as the British in suppressing their enemies.

By the 1920s to 1940s, the Muslim league and various Hindu communities gained power and perpetrated their own violence before and after independence.

What the British and also the local princely Rajas in Rajastan are guilty of is trying to stop and delay the democratic independence movement by any means possible.
They targeted both Hindus and Muslims meetings of different states and ethnicities.
They didn't care how many they killed on either side.
There was no favouritism.

https://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/174489-A-painful-chapter-of-Indian-history-The-Mangarh-massacre-1913.aspx

This lead to massacres like Mangarh Rajastan Massacre (1913) where indian troops from the British army and troops from the local Rajas army opened fire on democratic meetings killing 1500 people at a political rally.
The British did the same thing alone at Amritsar (1919) and in Gujarat (1922) with similar numbers.

Meanwhile in other parts of India, there was massacres of 10,000 Hindus and Muslims in Kerela (1921).
Nothing to do with the British, it started as a dispute between peasants and landlords.
Then religious groups got involved and it became Muslim vs Hindu problem. Ethnic and religious violence also took place in Calcutta (1946) where political Muslim and Hindu parties encouraged genocide of each other on ethnic grounds.
These events happened co currently to the British and Rajas suppressing Independence protests by shooting them.

Once the British army left in 1947, the Muslim league and the new majority Hindu government took the guns and the massacres didn't stop for 10 years.
They say a few million died.

In short, many of these countries were experiencing violence and division before, during and after the British rule.

British rule in  Sri Lanka didn't have the problems or massacres that British rule in India had.
It was mostly peaceful up until Bandaranike in the 1950s.

But that's also because the situation in India was much worse even before the British came to India among the Mughals and Martha's etc. And it never got better.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/xan5p9/rajapaksa_simps_and_british_simps_ironically_have/io3z2oc/,1662982154.0

Despite colonial sympathisers absolutely hating Rajapaksa supporters with everysingle cell in their bodies they have a lot in common with them, especially when it comes to how they defend their chosen cult leader whether its the British or the Rajapaksas.  Realising that you are using the same logic as a group of people that you absolutely despise can be a very disturbing revelation and one that will take time to come to terms with.

xan5p9,,comment,"We're talking about India now. 
Pity you guys don't want to talk more about Sri Lanka.

1. I think India has a history of near constant famines.
Millions dying.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_India

Under Maratha and Mughal rule, even hundreds of years before millions died regularly.
This indicated the problem was really endemic to the geography.

The Famine in Bengal 1943 was a result of crop failure, cyclone and definitely corruption from the British admin, but it's was not a genocide. 
Academic studies are very clear on that.

The same thing happened in Ireland 1845.
Yes, the British mismanaged both.
But there was enough pre existing conditions for a disaster. Not to mention the British ended the Famine in 1944 anyway.

2. I think most of what Tucker said was actually true, but alot of what Prasanth said was also true.
Nobody can agree that the British did not build the infrastructure, the schools, the transportation, and provided the ground works for a great legal system. Alot of that was used to bring wealth to the upper class, the ruling rajas and ofc the British admin.

3. The India Pakistan conflict is really the fault and responsibility of the Indians and the Pakistanis themselves. 
The bloke who drew the map Cyril Radcliffe was asked by Indian and Pakistani leaders to do.
The British were seen as a third party.

In short, they were fighting when the British got there and they were fighting when thr British left.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_India

I don't have to mention that India had not been united completely for hundred of years.
Before that there was constantly wars and periods of peace followed by more wars.
Like every other country.
It's wasn't ""paradise"".


I think Prasanth is correct in his assertion about the following.

1. British rule was corrupt
2. British rule favoured the British and the local elite (obviously)
3. India is doing a wonderful job today
4. Independence was a struggle and the British only gave India back after 50 years of struggle.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/xan5p9/rajapaksa_simps_and_british_simps_ironically_have/iqp57bz/,1664675225.0

I see that explains, but I suggest you stay out of things that you have absolutely no idea about. If you want to know [here's ](https://www.grin.com/document/1164560) an article that explores how colonial British policies implemented in SL were designed to create ethnic tensions within the country and how these policies are similar to the ""divide and conquer"" strategies that the British used in their other colonies too inorder to put minorities up against majorities so that the people won't see the British as the enemy rather their own neighbour. This made it easier to maintain their rule over colonies and the indoctrination programs they ran in schools where children were brainwashed into worshiping the British king as a literal god and how he was their saviour and how they should be grateful for him for ""civilising"" the inferior brown skinned  animal also helped them continue their rule.

1kah041,,comment,"There are actually socio-economic reasons for such treatment by locals. Often increased tourism leads to gentrification of neighborhoods, shady business dealings, increased property prices and cost of living. Driving locals out of their own towns and cities. Sri Lanka is relatively better compared to places like Bali. If you look at towns like Ahangama, Weligama etc they’ve changed so much and not in the sense of development that benefits locals. More cafes, yoga studios etc etc which locals can’t event afford. Not to mention settler tourism. 

I was once in Ahangama and a local told me that they can’t even afford to buy fruits in their own town anymore and have to travel to the next one. Because of increased prices.",37,/r/srilanka/comments/1kah041/especially_the_case_for_nonwhite_tourists/mpmdbsb/,1745910457.0

1kah041,,comment,"Worst treated tourists are the Sri Lankans that immigrated to other countries and are back with bags of money to splurge in SL while on vacation. 

Happened to me, literally wanted to throw a party for my family and friends in SL last year so I called a this very popular beach resort in negombo. I arrived in a tuk and let them know who I was meeting at the front desk. They had me wait in a closed off part of the restaurant and I waited for 30mins and I was about to leave since I had another appointment soon. 

The rep was giving “you can’t afford vibes” while discussing the various halls in the venue I got a call from one of my business partners on a deal we’ve been working on via FaceTime and I was talking to him in english and after she asked me if I was from abroad and I was like yes and her questions went deeper to asking where and what I do and I played along and told her what I do and all. I sensed her attitude was starting to change, she offered to clear a date that I had asked for earlier that was held (tentative date) for another customer and I told her I’ll get back to her on it. 

I ended up taking my business elsewhere and just ghosted her. She called back a few times later to follow up and offered to give me really big discounts but I told her that the reason I went with another vendor was specifically because of how she had treated me in the beginning of the meeting, I went to the place as I have a family that owns a stake in the parent company of the resort, I dropped a few names of execs of her company which I know on a very personal level. She profusely apologized I just told her not to make the same mistake again.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1kah041/especially_the_case_for_nonwhite_tourists/mqyb4k8/,1746564944.0

1kah041,,comment,"You can thank the Portuguese, Dutch and British for instilling this mentality into people here. There was no colourism in our region or anywhere in the world for that matter prior to the white folks beginning their colonization campaign. It was used as a way to subjugate the locals through divide and conquer tactics. It's ignorance that has led to this kind of thinking being prevalent in our society to this day.

I had an incident recently at the Galle Face mall that really made me see how deeply ingrained this thinking still is here. Saw a digital billboard next to Calvin Klein that had a model of African descent and then I walked past Hameedias, a chain that's been operating exclusively in Sri Lanka since the 1920s and all they had were European models on their billboard. Calvin Klein has dark skinned models but we still put Europeans on our shit. It's truly pathetic.

1lmdyn8,,comment,"Just wanted to give everyone an update before taking the video down.

This happened this morning when I came for my usual weekend morning chai. I didn't start recording expecting it to go south, but as it was escalating, showing them people are watching was the only thing I could do. Fortunately for the woman being beaten, the incident defused because their attention turned towards me.
I told the guy to leave as they tried to enter the cafe to threaten me. When I told him I'm calling the cops, he ran away like the pussy he is. (Sorry but raising your hand against an unarmed woman will automatically make you a pussy of a man)

A couple of minutes later the two ladies who came with the guy barged into the cafe and started shouting at me saying this was something between the couple and I shouldn't get involved thinking I was staff. Their tone changed significantly when they realised I was a customer.
Huge appreciation for the two brave cashier girls in the cafe that came forward to de-escalate the situation and kindly asked them to leave in a very mature way.

There are a couple of people DMing me shaming me for not getting involved. here's my stance. Like a few of y'all correctly said, I am a third party. The argument of the women that came to cause a scene in the cafe was was that if I had any women in my life, I wouldn't record it. Yes, because if someone if this was happening to a woman I knew, I would have definitely got involved and not stood and watched. But that was not the case here and this definitely would've backfired if i got involved in any other way.
Some of y'all don't know how to handle situations like this and it shows. 

Y'all are shaming the cafe, failing to understand that its not the café we should be discussing on the post. The place doesn't deserve the hate y'all are spewing. They've got some nice chai you should try out.

EDIT : 

peeps who wanted to know if I'm hurt, no I'm not. Thank you for the genuine concern.
Some saying I'm less of a man for not getting into a physically altercation, y'all really just jump in get physical when you see random street fights? Poddak moda paatai kiyala hithenne nadda?",194,/r/srilanka/comments/1lmdyn8/this_just_happened_in_kollupitiya/n07ijqx/,1751097938.0

1lmdyn8,,comment,Of course the woman will defend the abuser or else she will suffer worse when she gets home from the abuser - that’s how domestic abuse works - he has to keep her in a position of fear - if she goes against him in public he will beat her black and blue in private to teach her a lesson.

1lmdyn8,,comment,"Good thing you didn’t escalate it.  
If it were me?  
I’d let him throw that first punch — one clean swing caught on camera, right on company property.  
Now it’s assault. And I’m not just some random guy — I’m a customer. He’s just an angry idiot having a public tantrum.

Later…

Police report filed.  
Lawsuit launched.  
Media might even pick it up — *“Unprovoked Attack on Innocent Civilian.”*  
He gets dragged through court and blacklisted by every decent employer in the area.

But I’m not done.  
I claim trauma, long-term anxiety. ( I don't know if there is such a thing in Srilanka, if so)  
Therapy bills stack up — and I send them straight to him.

Meanwhile, I post the video everywhere — TikTok, Reddit, X.  
He becomes a meme — a walking reminder of what happens when emotion overrides intelligence.

But beyond all that…

I start watching him. Every move. Every breath.  
Learn his routine, his friends, his weaknesses.  
I appear just out of sight — a shadow in the background.

Anonymous messages arrive.  
Small, disturbing things.  
“Did you lock your door?”  
“Someone’s watching.”  
“He knows what you did.”

At work, rumors grow toxic, choking the air around him.  
His phone buzzes with unknown numbers — silent calls at midnight.  
His reflection in the mirror begins to feel… wrong.

Friends drift away. His world fractures, piece by piece.  
And I stay calm.  
Invisible.  
Waiting.

When he finally breaks, no one will know why.  
But I’ll be there.  
Smiling.

Because it's joy.  
(ill be doing all this not because I don't have anything better to do but solely because I have something to play with)

Biometrics (Faces and Fingerprints):
Biometric data, including facial features and fingerprints, are unique identifiers used for authentication and security. While not typically considered IP, they are increasingly being recognized as personal data and subject to regulations like the state laws. 

Signatures:
Signatures can be protected under trademark law, especially when used to identify a brand or product.

Protection under Specific Laws:
Trademarks: Signatures can be trademarked if they are used to distinguish goods or services in commerce. 
Copyright: While fingerprints and signatures can be part of a copyrighted work (e.g., a drawing of a fingerprint), the fingerprint itself is not generally copyrightable unless it demonstrates sufficient creativity. 

Privacy Laws: Biometric data, including facial recognition and fingerprints, is increasingly subject to privacy regulations designed to protect individuals' personal information.",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1lmdyn8/this_just_happened_in_kollupitiya/n0i12y2/,1751244842.0

Yes, RW has blood in his hands, but which leader in the world doesn't. And he allegedly carried all these out when he wasn't even the president. Why didn't the ruling parties or the subsequent ones convict him of all these crimes?

He seemed to be the lesser of the evils we had over the past few decades, but he turned out to be the most competent among them all.

Remember when everyone celebrated Gota's win? Well, it's deja vu. You're celebrating someone who hasn't proved anything yet and at the same time mocking others who doesn't fit your personal agenda.

1fms0jd,,comment,"It’s sad to see people with no political knowledge get to participate in one of the crucial elections to choose the next leader of the country. They all believe what they heard but they refuse to believe what they experienced, before their own eyes. 
I respect Mr RW for all what he has done for this country. He maybe unlucky at elections, least popular politician of them all but remember he is the only politician who never lied to the people. Everything that he has been accused of, being branded are just for politics. I’ve seen the man in action in 2002-2004, the strategic moves that he made are incredible. Few of his projects got completed by MR and stole the credits for it too. 2015 until MY3 screwed them over, he did an incredible job by boosting entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately MY3 and MR had to screw him all over again along with Sajith. 
The last couple of years people maybe wondering why he didn’t do what we wanted him to do, to put MR and his family in Prison, and if he did so he will be the most popular candidate in the election. But he had set his goals far more than what we can understand. Stabilizing the economy without creating a conflict between the governing party, cause SJB won’t help him in any way whatsoever. 
For me personally I believe he did an incredible job, outstanding president! For people who hate him for everything that he has done, I like to say good luck! Lot more disappointments and struggles are on your way!

We hit rock bottom and had nowhere to go but up, stop praising placeholder presidents who did literally nothing, stagnated the issue at numerous points and stole credit from other people

IMF was done before Ranil  
Nandalal was done before Ranil  
Money printing stopped before Ranil  
Fuel crisis was solved by India's $4 billion, something also done before Ranil

All of the above were the crucial steps at resetting and all are something Ranil used in his campaign points as if he did them so even he agrees they're important. But he didnt' contribute to any of those in the first place, its all lies.

Businesses shutting down and stopping imports and letting people suffer and leave is what saved us

1fms0jd,,comment,">It's not easy to actually execute them.

Did you read the parts where he didn't actually execute them? Or the part where we're still in a crisis? Or the part that Ranil directly contributed to the crisis in the first place? Or the part where more deaths occurred because of his unchecked health crisis because he was protecting crooks? Or the parts where he took out more loans? Or the parts where the public took the brunt of the responsibility and how Ranil stole credit from every entity he could? For your ""nitpicking in retrospect"" you sure ignore India's contribution, the rest of the world's contribution and most importantly the public's contribution.

And what nitpicking? Fuel, IMF, printing money and Nandalal were all crucial moves to resetting the economy, Ranil agrees himself that's why he uses them in campaign points and pretends he was responsible for them. Your task is to prove he actually did not to undermine and pretend they are trivial moves.

The SL public is very lenient with shitty leaders, Ranil had 2 years to prove the bare minimum and couldn't even make the top 2 candidates in the vote, the public knows his stint was full of shit because the ones who aren't English speaking and in Colombo actually had to live through the worse shit of their lives

Every time SL went to the IMF we did similar things, what Ranil did was in fact the bare minimum that every other president who went to the IMF (which in some cases he was PM for those too) did because they had no other choice. **By your logic we should praise Gota for going to the IMF and remoing Ajith**

The issue is you guys keep falling for the premise of govt propaganda that Ranil swooped and and managed things properly when no matter who was at the helm at the time they would have been forced to do the same/better things. E.g. if Gota didn't remove Ajith and replace him with Nandalal (again, something Ranil not only didn't do but attacked him for) we would have started killing MPs and the govt knew that, meaningless comparisons to Zimbabwe and Lebanon are used as manipulations to deflect from what really happened.

Like you can't even list specifics as to what he did, this just proves more that you're parroting propaganda, this kind of speak works on an easily manipulated public but anyone asking for actual facts isn't falling for this or the last 2 years of nonsense we lived through. All this talk about ""respect"" is nonsense, Ranil was a failure, protected crooks, contributed heavily to deaths and made bouncing back from rock bottom seem like a heroic success that he did

The economy isn't ""stable"" it hit rock bottom with nowhere to go but up, since then we've barely made progress and reverted back to stagnation. You're using propaganda and the drama of fuel queues to make a point while ignoring actual stats and issues that happened.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1fms0jd/thank_you_ranil_thank_you_for_everything_you_did/lohmqw0/,1727073973.0

 Religious teachings are something that someone can choose to follow. 

Don't all major religions on their core concepts say don't force your ideas on others? 

How can they say how people should live their lives? What gives them the right and power? How are they special? 

Religion has no right to be in a country's governance. These monks and priests should shut the fuck up and just mind their own business.


Most of the major laws of this country regarding abortion, rape, woman's rights, queer rights, animal rights, religion ,marriage are from the fucking late 1800s and the early 1900s. We just kept following them like sheep without reforming them.

It's quite easy to vindicate even the acts of blasphemy with a handful of reprobates, spineless politicians and a bunch of sycophants.

But I guess anything I say would come out as hate content toa few fragile homos in this sub!

Nevertheless, I'll say everything I have to say. First and foremost, throughout the history there was never a person who found solace or attained his Nirvana by changing his gender. Just because a very few fathers abused some minors doesn't really hold the entire the diocese accountable of P3dopehlia, especially not in this country the reports are very low comparing to US/ Vatican or whatever. I'm well aware of those cases.

I believe what the archbishop trying to prevent is not exercising individual freedom of being able to pass the law to same sex marriages, but the social, demographic, political repercussions that would follow.

Think about the aftermath! drop in birthrates, political instability (which would give rise to opposition party like the likes of Namal), internal conflicts, and then how would a conventional parent explain to their six-year-old, when he asks ""why two men are kissing each other?"" especially in public.

1o05mrx,,comment,"I love how you so confidently know that no one's ever found solace by changing their gender... and I mean you're not wrong, to attain Nirvana is to give up all worldly desires, which includes a man's desire to bed a woman and vice versa.

You're right! the entire diocese isn't accountable for the actions of a few priests. However, when something of this nature happens (that too repeatedly) it's quite obvious that actions must be taken.

The problem here isn't the fact that it happened (it's absolutely problematic but it could happen anywhere) but rather the fact that it's actively kept behind closed doors and little to no justice is ever delivered. It's almost as if they're afraid that their fragile walls may crumble at the slightest crack... which, could be true at this point in time due to their own actions, but hey, it's never too late!



Regarding your next points:

1) Birthrates are dropping whether you like it or not, and it's not a matter of the LGBT community. If you bothered to look around you'd see that the world is a pretty messed up place to have kids right now.

2) The political landscape of Sri Lanka has been unstable for a long time, not really something new per se.

3) I have no idea how gay people cause ""internal conflicts"" lmao. If anything it's bigots like you who cause so called ""internal conflicts.""

4) A ""conventional"" parent wouldn't need to... it's as normal as seeing a man and a woman kissing, homophobia isn't something people are born with... it's something which a bigoted society teaches.

5) No one's trying to dare social norms, people just want to live peacefully and happily. Also if anything, social norms are a construct of society (aka the people) and can be flawed in some cases.

And finally, our nation has been bananas for the past few decades, and if seeing two people of the same gender kissing makes you go bananas then I'd highly recommend seeking medical help!

Redline has been targeted by fake reviews mostly originating from elakiri.com, usually for the fact that they are predominantly a Muslim owned store. There were one or two individuals who openly stated this and kept targeting them.

Example - https://elakiri.com/threads/redline-muslim-hettange-business-kadamu.1745103/

Before starting threads like this (and some even commenting review bombing then again), do your research, or you'll be part of the same toxicity.

Disclaimer: I was a regular customer of them for a long time. I had no issues with my purchases or warranty claims. Last I purchased from them was 5+ years back so I dont know if they have become better or worse lately.

And if you search Elakiri you will see this topic comes up from time to time and Redline gets review bombed every time it does. I didnt bother to search and post all the thread links - you can do your own research on that.

If you roamed around that forum, you'd notice that this is a popular topic over there and if I remember correctly Redline lodged some legal complaint regarding this back then as well.

> For example, imagine two individuals each purchase $100 of clothing per week, and they each pay $7 in tax on their retail purchases. The first individual earns $2,000 per week, making the sales tax rate on her purchase 0.35 percent of income. In contrast, the other individual earns $320 per week, making her clothing sales tax 2.2 percent of income.

This is from the wiki

> Sri Lankan tax system is regarded as one of the most complicated tax structures in the world.

He was not part of the Signal brand akit. That was the girl in question, two bacteria, and the Signal Hero character. It was a damsel-in-distress type thing where the Signal Hero jumps in and saves the girl from the bacteria.

This is the dude that crashed the skit and tried to run off with the girl.

1mx0sy9,,comment,"
If “everything a head of state does is automatically official,” then no president or PM in the world could ever be held accountable for abusing the perks of the office. But that’s just not how law works anywhere. The difference is between security/logistics that are inseparable from the office (which the state pays for) versus tacking private engagements onto the taxpayer’s bill. That’s exactly why Ranil’s case ended up in court.

This isn’t new or unique to Sri Lanka. Look at France: François Fillon (former PM, 2020 conviction) was given a suspended jail term and heavy fines because he used state funds for his wife’s “fake” employment, mixing personal with public resources. In South Korea, Park Geun was impeached and jailed partly for letting private interests piggyback on official functions and resources. In South Africa, Jacob Zuma was ordered to pay back millions spent from the state treasury on “security upgrades” to his private Nkandla home, the court ruled those weren’t legitimate state expenses. Even in the UK, MPs were prosecuted and jailed during the expenses scandal 2009 for claiming taxpayer money on personal costs.

The pattern is the same: if you cross the line and dress up private perks as “official duty,” you open yourself up to criminal liability. Ranil didn’t just visit London, he scheduled nothing official there, then billed a personal family ceremony to the public purse. That’s the problem. Anura going to his hometown, or any leader traveling within their own country, falls under normal security and official logistics. You can’t seriously equate a domestic trip with a fully private detour abroad funded by state coffers.

If “everything is official,” then by that logic Zuma’s pool, Fillon’s wife, or the UK MPs’ luxury claims were all fine too. Yet they all ended in fines, jail time, or impeachment. That’s exactly why Ranil is in the dock today.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1mx0sy9/this_is_the_first_time_in_sri_lankan_history_that/nad7lpg/,1756012714.0

Private bus unions have cautioned police to adhere to the Motor Traffic Act and avoid measures that could lead to a bus strike.

The Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association expressed concerns about inspections under the “Clean Sri Lanka” program, particularly the deployment of plainclothes officers on buses.

Gemunu Wijeratne, the association’s chairman, said discussions with the Acting Inspector General of Police are planned for next week, during which the union will address its grievances. A strike initially set for next week has been temporarily suspended pending the outcome of the talks.

To change as a person is challenging. Imagine changing as a society.. Can we even change ourselves? Or even those around us? It's not impossible, it's just very hard labor.

Cardinal Rule of Human Behavior change is ""What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.""  I believe things should be changed accordingly to this. We can't force change, we should create circumstances to make it happen. Built an environment/society that encourages change.

This CLEAN SRI LANKA movement wouldn't last unless it becomes something that people do repeatedly, without forcing them to. If this died out, they should start this again with the help of  Behavioral Scientists to seed this idea into society to bloom into a better future for all of us.",5,/r/srilanka/comments/1hvgpaa/clean_sri_lanka_campaign_change_others_not_me/m5twccf/,1736228539.0

But unless we have written specific rules for this, policemen are going to abuse this.

klpr2z,,comment,"Great work
Love them. 
Someone already pointed out the hayleys spelling mistake, and also fix the SLIC one (Sri Lanka not Sri Lankan)
If it were a real client something small like that could be enough to unnerve them. 
Especially because I guarantee not all the decisions makers in a firm will be happy or ready to change something as important as a logo at the same some. Some people will be 100% against the idea even if you design something amazing, so try to leave the minimum room for those people to reject a redesign. 

I agree with the other redditor who said all except 6. It just too iconic and at best, you could keep the original guy an remove the circle and text. 

Also, if you aren’t already part of it you should join and post this on r/logodesign they’ll be able to give more international and experience feedback for you

187omyk,,comment,"Leopards don’t usually attack humans, they’re scared of us due to Leopards skin hunters (They can sense humans from far away and usually escape even before we see them), But one can never trust an animal. Although there are only little to none incidents of leopards attacks from the past decade (The most famous one is the Yala Safari Jeep attack, I think it was 2012 or so, can’t quite remember) it is better to be calm in a such situation and never to approach the animal. It is advised to ignore the big cat (never losing focus on it) and calmly walk/go away from it, without making sudden moves. The couple from the video handle the situation very well, yet it is frightening to see the big cat not getting scared of them. By the looks of it, It could’ve attacked if they stopped.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/187omyk/what_you_gonna_do_if_you_come_across_a_situation/kbjofhx/,1701438645.0

1idhrz2,,comment,"Ya'll are all wrong to blame India. Granted they do have a serious air quality problem, it's mostly exasperated by their geography.
We too have little to not emission control, no subsidies for environmentaly friendly vehicles. We're just lucky that we're an island with no pockets to trap dirty air unlike India. We should first do the best we can to reduce our own emissions and establish systems to control particulate matter in the air. Once we have established a baseline, then we should implement policies to improve the quality of air. If at that point there are huge fluctuations in air quality with shifting winds and pressure, then we can tell India to shove it. Until that time, we have to do something about it ourselves.

On the surface at least to me, it took them a slap or a good talking to for some of them to fall in line.

As for religion, my school was completely secular, but if I had my way it would be comparative religion from grade 1 to grade 12. No worship. No prayers. No dogma.

If person A is going to be more popular because they are more personable than person B, why would the producers select B?

I highly doubt the entire village celebrating part, though. That never happens in Sri Lanka. The village culture here is like: Oh look, that guy got married, I gotta marry someone prettier.

Now, about comparing women's rights in Sri Lanka to India, I really don't think you can. It's literally like night and day. India ranks 128th out of 177 countries in the ***Women Peace and Security Index***. For comparison, Sri Lanka ranks 60th. That's a HUGE difference.

The problem with idiots is that they can be easily manipulated by “experts,” especially those who climbed to the top through Sri Lanka’s corrupt government service and bureaucracy.

He was misled by many and ended up making one disastrous decision after another:

1. Kabral and the Pohottuwa economic “experts” :  Pushed for reckless tax cuts, artificially fixed the dollar rate, and ignored the falling forex reserves.
2. GMOA and Dr. Padeniya : Convinced him to adopt organic agriculture. He even fired experienced agricultural experts who opposed it.
3. Transport “experts” :  Persuaded him to cancel the LRT project.
4. Health “experts” :  Promoted indigenous medicine(Dhammika paniya) to fight COVID and insisted on prioritizing young people over vulnerable elderly populations, which led to significantly more deaths among the elderly.
5.  He lifted lockdowns based on military opinion instead of medical advice, and even sacked the Health Secretary for opposing him.

1l1384l,,comment,"On June 2, 1987, a bus carrying Buddhist monks and a few unarmed civilians, en route from Mahavapi to Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, was ambushed near Nuwaragalatenna by approximately 20 armed LTTE cadres. The attackers forced the bus into the Aranthalawa jungle, where they brutally murdered 33 monks, including 30 young novices aged between 7 and 18, along with four civilians. The chief priest, Hegoda Sri Indrasara Thera, pleaded for the novices' lives before being hacked to death. This cold-blooded massacre, targeting defenseless children and religious figures, underscores the LTTE's ruthless tactics during the civil conflict marked among the darkest chapters of our history riddled with nearly 30 years of terrorism which we've been fortunate enough to move past. But today, we solemnly remember the innocent lives lost, honour their memories and refresh our pledge to never let twisted forces of terrorism ever take root in this country again.",162,/r/srilanka/comments/1l1384l/remembering_the_victims_of_the_arawanthalawa/mvi1qyk/,1748820734.0

During the attack he stuck his head under his alms bowl (paththare) while the terrorists hacked at them with swords and machetes.(He is seen in the back of the bus in this photo) . It was because of that bowl which offered minimal protection that he survived. Unable to bear with the atrocities he saw committed he left robes and joined the SLA as a radio set operator and infantryman . To avenge the 37 innocents killed he would rack up a killcount of exactly 37 LTTE Cardes during his time in service. He lost a leg which ultimately forced him to retire . This is is interview and eyewitness account of what happened that day :

1l1384l,,comment,"Background

The Eastern province was a highly contested zone between the Sinhalese and Tamils. Since the 1930s, the Sinhalese-dominated government settled Sinhalese in the Eastern province, claiming to restore what they saw as lost ancient Sinhala settlements, as well as to reduce the Tamils' claim to local autonomy. Tamil nationalists viewed this as an attempt to alter the demographics of their 'traditional Tamil homeland', thus weakening the Tamils' stake in it.

During 1983, Trincomalee was the site of anti-Tamil violence at the hands of Sinhalese mobs and security forces. During 1985 massacres, there was widespread, systematic destruction of Tamil villages and massacres of Tamil civilians in Trincomalee District by the Sri Lankan Army with the help of Sinhalese settlers, nearly destroying the Trincomalee Town and displacing its population. Following this, there had been a series of massacres of Sinhalese by Tamil militants and of Tamils by the Army and home guards in the Trincomalee District that continued into 1986.

This will be an unpopular opinion coming from a Sinhalese but I don't think making fun of LTTE people will help mend the relationship Sinhalese and Tamils have in this country today. When pro LTTE people post pics of Sri Lankan soldiers who passed away how do we feel?.

Regardless of whether you agree with prabhakaran/LTTE or if you despise his brand of terroristic guerrilla warfare keep in mind just like we lost our relatives in this war they did too. They have emotions just like us and whenever both sides joke around like this the divide will never be mended.

vbwbju,,comment,"Lawyer here 


And no it's not an offence punishable by law 


There are two types of offences in the Sri lankan penal system (or rather any penal system) 
 Non statutory offences and statutory offences 

Non statutory offences are your regular day to day crimes where they look into the physical element of the crime and the mental element of the crime 

For an example in a case of murder the court will look into factors like why did the person commit it. If the accused can show factors like self defence (thus showing no ill will) then you can literally get away with zero consequences. 

Statutory offences are offences where they don't look at the intention but rather the simple fact of commiting that action itself is sufficient

An example would be having sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16

She might have given explicit consent, you might even have her giving consent on video, she might come to court and give evidence on your behalf that it was voluntary but none of this matters 

The simple fact of commiting it itself is sufficient to get you 20 years in prison 


So in the above case of op, displaying the eelam flag in a post like this is not necessarily a statutory offence, thus his intention matters. 


Also I'm not too sure as to whether the displaying of the flag it self is an offence, but nevertheless even if it is 

It's immaterial",20,/r/srilanka/comments/vbwbju/prabhakaran_always_reminded_me_of_super_mario_so/icb6c25/,1655198875.0

>making fun of LTTE people

It's a joke comparing Prabha (who is a terrorist btw, not some messiah who people should venerate, even so, everyone makes fun of religious figures, have you seen the internet my guy?) to Mario lol how is that making fun of LTTE people? I don't see anyone getting butthurt over  memes about Gota or anyone. Making fun of the actual soldiers would indeed be triggering to people, but this is Prabha lol, a terrorist leader by admission of everyone except racist Eelam sympathizers. You saying we should be walking around on eggshells when it comes to Prabhakaran? Most in this thread is only talking about how accurate and funny the physical comparison is. I don't see how this could be taken as making fun of LTTE people. Boy I sure hope you don't see any memes about that angry moustache model from Germany.

So in short, this isn't considered making fun of Tamils, or the LTTE soldiers and its perfectly fine to make fun of Prabha, make as many jokes about Sinhala leaders as much as you want! So either you either failed to grasp this simple notion, or you have a soft spot for good old Prabha (whats another phrase for that? hmmmm).

t6gm7h,,comment,"saw your post asking about him cause you are an immigrant child of Sri Lankan parents. I'm running a bit late today, so I'll explain in brief and some others might add the things I might forget  


**- Dirty politics here!**  
He appoints the people he wants to the positions which play a critical role in law enforcement. He made the court (Supreme, maybe. Don't wanna get arrested like Ranjan) release many people after making them relieved of all the accusations including criminals and the people responsible for the Easter Sunday attack.  


**- Shitty ruling**  
!He came to the election like a superhero and have no experience in politics. When some students in a school told him ""Our computers are broken, we separated parts and checked 2 out of 5"" his answer was ""Didn't you check the other 3?""

&#x200B;

**- Excessive expenses for media attention**  
He goes from village to village to know about the problems faced by rural people. It was something he planned to do for a while, but I can't remember it very much. He goes there and speaks with people about their problems. Just because he comes, stages and other facilities are arranged for him, which can be used for the betterment of the villages.

  
**- Autocratic behaviour**  
Once he was out in an above kind of a programme where he was told about an issue about not getting something provided to people by the government by a village woman. Then the president asked an officer responsible for that sector and he said all of it was provided and no more stocks. (Or something like that, anyway, the point was she was not given because of not allocating enough) Then the president told him to give it and the officer told him that he needs a circular to do it. Then the president said **Whatever I say is a circular.**

\[I can remember a comment by my History teacher about that incident. He said the people were stupid to clap when he said that (People clapped when the president said that) He said ""What if a secretory comes to the president when he's raging with anger and ask him for a sign?"" The president might lose it and say ""Stuff it in your a$$"" and then the teacher said ""Whatever he says is a circular and that man must literally do it!""\]

**- Releasing Dumind Silva**  
Hiru TV owner's brother Duminda silva was released from prison with special presidential powers. He was sentenced to death because of a murder. It was done in public and yet released him cause his brother's TV channel helped Gota during his presidential campaign a lot.(And yet, they kept Ranjan Ramanayaka in prison for speaking out the truth)

  
**- Destroying economy**  
When he came to power, 1 USD was worth 170-180 SLR, but now it's about 200$. They wasted dollars we had on useless projects from which they can take a commission and gave those dollars to their business friends at a lower rate through government banks. And they pointed out so many rupee notes making the value of the SLR go down making the inflation increase by 15% as of today. And then started distributing that newly printed money to people during covid to cover up their failure.

&#x200B;

**- Treating best friends with special privileges.**  
 A tax of Rs.50.00 per kg is charged from the imported sugar. When his friends imported sugar one time, he lowered the tax to Rs.00.25 *(25 cents or the previous tax divided by 200 or 0.5% of the previous tax )* And then his friends were able to sell sugar at the same old rate giving them an extra profit of Rs.49.75 per every kilogramme of sugar.

**- 20th amendments of the constitution**  
They got 2/3 power in the parliament and made changes to the parliament giving the president more powers and making the law enforcement sector politically vulnerable.some interesting facts  
= Presidents transactions and expenses can not be investigated anymore  
= President could appoint supreme court judges before, but couldn't remove them. With the new amendment, he can appoint and fire them both. *(It's the god mode baby!)*

**- Taking a big sum of dollars from Sri Lanka to Nigeria (Unconfirmed)**  
This is unconfirmed as they had no comments. Recently Mahinda R went to Thirupadi kovil to take blessings as he is one of the best and well-known Buddhists in Sri Lanka. He used a private jet provided by a businessman friend to go there. They say that [about 102 tons of printed paper was taken to Uganda](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/210418/news/sla-uplifts-102-tons-of-printed-material-to-uganda-but-refuses-to-give-details-440509.html) in that plane. They say it was just printed paper. I'm sure he wasn't going to start a press in Uganda with those papers. I'm sure they are not going to steal all the dollars from poor people like us.

These are some of the reasons why we hate him, not to mention the electricity, fuel problems.  
Had some more things to mention, but I'm really running late now.

Few days ago I thought I'll take a plunge. And since then, I learnt quite a lot about the party that rules my state, Andhra Pradesh. Yes, it is also a kind of ""dynasty"", in sense the current CM is the son of yesteryear CM. But that's all there it is.

The kind of people the party bought into politics is amazing. For example, they have chosen a [vegetable vendor](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra-pradesh/2021/mar/19/ysrcs-shaik-fayaz-basha-from-vegetable-seller-to-municipality-chief-2278671.html), gave him a ticket and he won.

11d70h7,,comment,"Dude, this isn't even the top of the iceberg.

Tea Estate Workers are some of the most fucked over social groups in Sri Lanka. They live in a fucked up form of indentured servitude where entire families can be bought and sold between estates. The amount of rape, abuse, and alcoholism would be off the charts if the estates and government allowed it to be charted. If they don't work, they'll be kicked out of their line rooms.

I've hung out with some guys who were doing a study on this, and they had some hellish tales to tell.

They are the reason why we don't have an hourly wage in Sri Lanka, and even the LTTE didn't consider them worthy of fighting for.

But Eris forbid anything be done to help them, because that would make tea too expensive.",112,/r/srilanka/comments/11d70h7/this_is_how_some_tea_gatherers_travel_why_these/ja75pil/,1677492133.0

11d70h7,,comment,"Being in estates all my life as a tea planters kid. I roamed around estates and spoke to these people. And yes they get low wages that's true, but the estates protect it's community of tea pluckers. The estate corporative gives food rations very cheap to compensate for the low wages, they receive free healthcare and protection at the highest priority (each estate has its own ambulance and is given the highest priority when admitted to the local dispensary or hospital).

 And they do have the freedom to leave the estates and find employment wherever they want (currently there's a gradual decline of estate workers as the younger generation have started to join garment factories etc, but they get abused worse over there from what I hear). But if they do leave the estates they have to leave behind the free housing given by the estates and the concessions. This makes them reluctant to find employment elsewhere and prefer being in estate communities. 

And also job security because during the pandemic most of the garment factory workers were laid off but in estates the workers have guaranteed job safety. Besides that the companies constantly try to uplift the standards of living for these people even though it's a slow process. 

These are some of the reasons amongst many others as to why these people stay in estates. 

Also the above picture is a normal sight when the estate lorry goes to town. Heck even I've hitched a ride once or twice. Please do understand that most estate workers live in extremely remote areas of the estate and there are no busses. The only mode of transport is walking, the estate tractor or lorry.

Also the estate workers are more communal and helpful to each other than you can ever imagine. Even domestic violence is not tolerated, there have been times when my father stepped in to solve domestic fights in the estates. 

So if you haven't lived in this community and interacted with actual workers of the estates (not the fellows along the nuwaraeliya main roads begging for your pity saying the estates don't treat them right)  you really shouldn't be judging what you see.

Having said that you can't really differentiate factories from your brands. The factories sell their products at an auction, bought by brands, shipped overseas, blended, and then sold.

So there is no way to determine where your tea comes from.

This is an industry that thrives and sustains itself on devaluing human lives and effort for profit and optics, and for a product that really serves no practical purpose. Can say the same of many industries but how many of them are loading their employees into cages to go to office?

11d70h7,,comment,"What do you mean by “adulterants”?

When I was there in 1972, we were told that Ceylon tea was mostly mixed with orange pekoe. And we were given blocks bigger than bricks of the pure stuff. It lasted ages for me, and boy, do I wish I could find it again. 

Our guide/hostess and gifter of the tea was the daughter of the plantation owner, and part of the Girl Scout/Girl Guide group I was traveling with, although she had been unable to make the whole trip with us. I wish I remembered her last name or the name of the plantation to try to get in touch with her. I only remember her first name.

Exploitation of labour and resources yields profit in the short term, in the long term it simply isn't stable.

(Edit: to elaborate)

Organisations and nations that rely on exploitation make it the foundation of their entire operation. This introduces a catastrophic single point of failure. (See: American Cotton Plantations, The East India Company). As a result, a single uprising/policy change/natural disaster/economic shift causes a massive cascading failure.

As much as there were times ('71 and '89) where the Sinhalese people lost their freedoms and rights, there has been a long systemic and systematic loss of rights for the minorities. The modern assault on these rights and freedoms can be said to have started with Anagarika Dharmapala, and has continued to this day.  


Pointing out a few years of lack of rights does not compare favourably against the literal decades where minorities lost their rights to jobs, language, education, official documentation in a language they can understand, or even a national anthem they could understand.  


so, yes, u/Gamerindreams, I HAVE heard of the 70s uprising, my father and uncles were caught up in it. and yes, u/xCuri0 and u/LankanFD6917, it happened in 89 and in Rathupaswala, but the majority is only now feeling a small portion of what the minorities suffered. fun fact, after the Rathupaswala shooting, there was one guy on TV asking ""we supported them, why are they treating us like like this?""  


Even in this sub there were minority folks explaining why the people of the North and East are not showing up in support of GotaGoGama and \\#gotagohome. The majority Sinhalese areas are suffering from a lack of power, fuel, necessities, rights and freedoms, and they are understandably and rightfully upset by that. But for the minorities, and especially those from the North and East, it's Tuesday.",16,/r/srilanka/comments/vshgx5/you_never_know_until_it_happens_to_you/if69j6e/,1657172817.0

Some of my friends of Sri Lankan background with Canadian passports have told me these guys would refuse based on your name. In fact, some hotels and AirBnBs would not book with a Sri Lankan sounding name (specially Sinhala sounding name).

Honestly, it is kind of their loss because most of the friends and family from Canada spend big in Sri Lanka compared to European backpackers they get in these places. Last time I was in Sri Lanka, my friends (Canadians) always overspend by given extra to roti stands on the side of roads. Their loss. 

On the other hand, openly discriminating to anyone like this is a UN Human Rights violation. If enough Sri Lankans, maybe from the powerful places stand up, these guys will get into trouble. This is open racism!",10,/r/srilanka/comments/1e3a709/a_regular_sight_in_arugam_bay/ld7x8fc/,1721003222.0

1e3a709,,comment,"Whataboutism will get you nowhere. Shame this person is being downvoted for telling the truth. I am not from the hotel industry but have been around long enougb to know that anyone who has run a tourist hotel down south (of any scale) knows the problems you have with:

A) the local area ‘thug’ lord requiring preference for his people, and also demanding ‘protection money’ to avoid damage to property. Most of these guys gave patronage from the local pradeshiya sabha or MP so if you want your hotel to survive then you fall in line.

B) Local men coming in groups, getting drunk and then harassing tourists (male and female alike). Resistance is futile as the groups from A) will ensure you shut down your business before long.

These issues have been going on for the past 50 years, they are not new. Look into the history of the problems the founders of places like Bentota beach hotel had to face. 

It seems like a lot of people on this thread are leading very sheltered or idealistic lives and have no idea how things actually operate on the ground in this country. 

I will agree on one thing; that a ‘no locals’ policy is NOT the way to go about it and probably is not done anywhere in the world.

Here is the bright side of the situation....some of these places actually lose a lot of money. They don't realized most Sri Lankans outside of Sri Lanka have lots of money to spend. Compared to poor European backpackers, some of the successful Sri Lankan origin people in countries like Canada, EU, Aus, etc spend good money. By blocking us access to these places, it will be their loss in my opinion. When it comes to restaurants (you guys sometimes called them hotels too) that won't allow me to enter.... I found a solution! I was so mad, to piss them off, I gave lots or big tips to roti stands on the side of the roads. HA HA HA... LOL This is a direct result of these kind of discrimination. In fact, I refused to spend my money whites only places anyway. Just help small families from a rural areas and eat from the family own small food stands on the side of the road! Screw these guys. Somewhere between Colombo and Banadarawela, we stopped at a roti stand. There was a small kid with the mom. It was night time. It was raining. I was told the kid was in Grade 7. The kid and the mom treated us very very well. They could not speak English so I had to speak Sinhala. They did not make fun of my accent or ask where I am from... they don't care. We gave them a lot more money than the rotis we ate (5 of us ate roti and tea and we gave over 20,000 rupees->4000 per person). I know this is not a lot but it was a lot to the family. The kid was so freaking happy. The mom was happy and thanked us. See.... screw these whites only restaurants. Let's promote spending money on these roti stands.

Since you asked, most of these foreigners only places have the same patronage from the local MP and have an unwritten rule that they will be allowed to run their business without local interference- at a very hefty fee.

Unfortunately, you are proving the point of the naiivete of many of this thread who appear completely isolated from grassroots Sri Lanka - instead of giving us your ‘ideal world’ solutions, give the solutions that will work in reality that I’m sure the owners of these establishments will implement with pleasure (instead of paying up to 60% of their earnings in kappang), if they could.

All these responses suggest why Sri Lanka stumbles from one mess to another- a population that appears to be in complete denial of reality.

In the bus shown in the video a girl gets into the bus and loud music was being played therefore she asked to turn the volume down but gets ignored the first time.

In response to this the people from other ethnic groups also say that they want to get off the bus as well with the girl.

Pretty sure Indians as a whole don't know about the Israeli genocide of Palestine either.. Not many Lankans know about those things either.. Even academics can be insular when it comes to the general public. And it's been 80 years since.. Ask a general person about world war 2 or even the current status of Palestine, Ukraine, China tensions and no one knows or cares..

Its not right but least the bastard had told them getting independence is good though if he had his way, he'd prolly invade & enslave India too, in the end.

Hell even Prabas struggles against us would have had a reasonable start & if he had been as popular where he'd say something good about a country, they might remember him well too.. 😂

rjuh9j,,comment,"Several Teachers’ associations and Main Student’s union of University of Colombo who have objected the appointment of Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thero to the position of the Chancellor of the University of Colombo showed their displeasure of it in the Ceremonial Graduation 2019 of the University of Colombo.

Many students participated in the graduation wearing black arm bands while some even refused to accept the certificate from Muruththettuwe Ananda Thero.

The Faculty of Management and Finance Teachers’ Association (FMFTA) also boycotted the event.

Issuing a statement, the trade union said the decision has been taken to show its displeasure on the appointment of Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thero to the position of the Chancellor of the University of Colombo.

On 6 November, the President addressed the media, where he spoke of the appointment.
“I gave the chancellor position to Ananda Thera. The monk helped this Government to come to power. He made contributions from the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, due to some reasons, the monk spoke against us recently. Parliamentarian and President’s Counsel Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and MP Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Thera and sought advice. People like Ceylon Teachers’ Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin and Ceylon Teachers’ Service Union General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe also went to seek advice. They all went to the Thera seeking advice but when the Thera becomes the Chancellor, they say that it is not appropriate,” said the President.

because Sri Lankans are culturally brainwashed into thinking white country = better country

the economic situation in Sri Lanka is bad(like any third world country), but its not hopeless, you can still live a comfortable life if you work hard enough and make the right choices, and its often less of a struggle than western countries. Sri Lankans simply dont understand this, and only realise how much of a challenge they've undertaken when they've moved abroad. the reality is if a majority of these immigrants knew how hard it is before they move abroad, they would never move, and would invest their resources into building a life in SL rather than spending it all on visas and other migration processes",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1ns0cqe/when_you_know_mahinda_has_stolen_from_us_but_you/ngnf7vp/,1759068112.0

Guess it’s your first time doing this journey. But it’s common sense that 4.00pm is peak office to home rush time. And you could’ve spent around 100/- and a half an hour to go back to kandy and get a seat from the beginning of the journey.

Also, not that it’s difficult to get a seat in a filled bus, but it’s a different skill.

No that will just create negative publicity for SL and we'll also be called a scam country like India or Egypt by tourist. Better for government to give proper regulations and information on this and ban such practices outright.

There the Czech Republic for example that did a similar thing.

Someone has written - This is Kalutara Vadani Vilas - so we know the name etc. which is important to show. 

But at least from my experience, when you call the SL Tourism department and make a complaint, they have been quite active. I complained about a beach hotel not allowing locals.

China hands out loans without any due diligence. That lack of oversight allows local politicians in that country to pilfer those funds. 

Now, since they're getting so rich off these loans, the local politicians kowtow even more to China. China loves that! Entire cabinet of a sovereign nation is kissing their feet just in exchange for a few billions in loans. So China releases even more funds to bring the country into its camp.

First they give loans to countries no one else would at high rates(because no one else would). Then they hire their own companies(most of them government companies) to build the project using their own engineers and material. All the loan money basically goes back to china and the recipient country is stuck with the loan. And if they can't pay the loan(which hasn't happened yet to more than a couple of countries) there's always govt guarantee clauses built in that ensure China gets its  money's worth. For eg Laos govt had to give up a huge stake in its highest source of govt revenue. 

A lot of countries struggle to service the debt but hardly anyone completely fails to. And even if they fail they aren't going anywhere because where's a whole country gonna go to.

ty3wkd,,comment,">Hambantota port

Although port operations started in 2011, following the completion of phase one of the project, Hambantota port was still incurring losses by 2016. According to the submissions made to a Parliament committee, the accumulated losses of Hambantota port was 46.7 billion Sri Lankan rupees (approximately $300 million) as of the end of 2016, just before the port was leased to CM Port.

Chinese loans were often at high rates. The first phase of the Hambantota port project was a $307 million loan at 6.3 percent interest. Multilateral development banks typically offer loans at rates closer to 2 or 3 percent, and sometimes even closer to zero. One reason China is successful in locking in these higher rates is that better alternatives are often unavailable. Another reason is that Chinese loans, while often requiring the partner to use Chinese contracts, are not as stringent in their requirements for safeguards and reforms.

The port is still not profitable and wont be profitable in the near future which is called white elephant.

**“At best a white elephant”**The new Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) in Sri Lanka has been described as “at best a white elephant with a very small catchment area”, and that “nobody flies there”.  And that was from SriLankan Airlines’ former CEO Suren Ratwatte.At the time (2018) it seemed that the airport would be taken over by Airports Authority of India (AAI), and that the plan seemed to be for AAI to invest in the airport. Mr Ratwatte added that, in terms of some of the large China-supported infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka: “Who the infrastructure was supposed to cater to, I really don’t know”.

You conveniently left out India's GDP PPP, which stands at around 10 trillion and the third highest in the world. India is poor but it also has a fuck-ton of money lying around. Similar to the USSR, large country = a lot of money. For comparison, some Indian states have a bigger economy than Sri Lanka, don't forget that little boy.

The problem isn’t the Chinese loans. It’s the ISBs that were sold on the market. These have the highest interest rates and account for around 45% of our external debt. That in addition to the massive current account deficit we’re running due to the fall in tourism and increase in fuel prices coupled with the government scrapping the market-based fuel pricing formula and the drop in agricultural output by 50% primarily due to the government’s policy of using organic fertilizer.

Anyway I used to be liberal and still am about some issues. But we have to look at outcomes. Traditional conservative Asian education systems... Japan, Korea, china and even India continue to produce better students. While western especially American education standards have drastically gone down. 

It's always good to take a step back and look at the larger picture. We should take only what's good from other cultures and to retain whatever positive traits we have in our own culture. I agree that the saree rule is silly. But screaming at them and calling people backwards isn't going to change their opinion.

If the people see successful women in business suits. They will associate it positively. You can't force change it takes time.

1ksseet,,comment,"Bro's trying to get laid,
And one day he will definitely get laid on the floor.

All jokes aside this is truly infuriating and almost every sector has such nutjobs.

Right after my A/Ls I started a temporary job as a car salesman at a company, I was the youngest MF there, everyone kept addressing me as ""Malli"", ""Malla"" and shit but I kept it strictly professional, and my manager told me that those guys are gossiping about me by telling that I'm too ""hot headed"", ""elite"" and that this is what happens to  guys who went to ""school name"" and shit.

Guess what; I pulled more sales within a span of 2 months compared to an approximation of what they pull within 5. On my final day I didn't say shit, I packed my stuff, took some gifts my supervisor and manager offered me and got out of my cubicle, I still am in contact with those two men, but I don't know what's up with those Jimmy Fallon wannabes.",82,/r/srilanka/comments/1ksseet/why_are_sri_lankan_banks_so_unprofessional/mtod6wc/,1747930009.0

There was a time when all formal digital communication was conducted via email. But now, for the sake of convenience, people have replaced it with platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, or SMS.

1lvww5h,,comment,"This 100%. As a sinhalese person, I'm so sick of sinhalese people denying that a genocide happened. Rwanda has fully acknowledged their genocide and look at them. They've built memorials acknowledging what happened between Huthus and Tutsis and they educate their population on how it happened. They've progressed so far that asking about someone's ethnicity in Rwanda is highly taboo, because no matter what, all Rwandans should be treated equal under their law. They also have far less corruption and a more stable economy than Sri Lanka.

Contrast that with the Sri Lankan government/society's response, constantly denying that a genocide even happened and refusing to hold perpetrators accountable. The government always has evidence against journalists critical of the government, but never seems to have enough against politicians or soldiers that committed war crimes. Nepotism is so rampant that basic services require you to know someone from within to get anything done. People are emigrating in droves to other countries because good salaries are hard to come by even for jobs highly in demand. All of this gives fuel to ltte sympathizers and corrupt politicians. 

No matter how you put it, the issues with the Sri Lankan economy are directly related to issues of racism/classism. Forget becoming the next Singapore, Sinhalese people need to realize that Sri Lanka won't even be close to Rwanda if we never acknowledge the wrongs that were committed against Tamils and give them justice.

For example the acts that ""acts that started the war"" one commenter mentioned the act but then made up what the acts were actually about and out right lying about one them but thats fine according to these people. It suits their narrative so it's okay.

2nd this letter that led to discovering the graves was signed under a different name then the person it was actually from then response was the commenter out right lying about the person's name. Again another out right lying about something to suit his narrative.

Every time these ""evidence"" and ""facts"" are questioned they get defensive about it, or throw hate or outright lie about it. And the classic response is I support the SL army or I believe the SL army did no wrong, none of which I have stated.

So far the only response I get to very basic questions about legitimacy are mostly hate and lies. So I were to draw my conclusion from just these interactions alone It looks like a bunch of LTTE supporters salty their little terrorists organization lost. 

But again as I have stated before I will refrain from judgement until there is complete evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. 


Time and time again almost every one of these posts and comments are all half truths and lies to suit a narrative. Under the pretense of wanting justice and finding the truth. Which in reality none of them seem to want. They only seem to want a truth that suits their narrative.

the best way, and most optimal, is to have a genuinely independent third party, non biased, sri lankan group that does the investigation, staffed with both tamil and sinhalese academics. the ethnic factor MUST be there to assure both communities that there is no ethnic bias in the investigation.

1lvww5h,,comment,"The Chemmani graves were uncovered after Jaffna was recaptured by the Sri Lankan Army in the mid 1990s. The first major lead came from a statement by a convicted Sri Lankan soldier, Somaratne Rajapakse, in 1998. He revealed that over 300 Tamil civilians who had been arrested or disappeared were allegedly buried in mass graves in Chemmani, implicating the military. Following this, an official investigation was launched and 15 bodies were exhumed. Forensic reports confirmed that the victims had been violently killed. These events occurred in an area under full military control at the time, not the LTTE. So the question of “how do you know this?” given the control of the region and the soldier’s confession, points clearly to elements within the Sri Lankan Army, not the LTTE.",71,/r/srilanka/comments/1lvww5h/body_count_at_chemmani_is_now_at_56/n2a9u5c/,1752110419.0

at the end of the day, this view of LTTE bad SLA good is naive. our side did plenty of bad shit aswell, and we need to prosecute them. if you purely look the numbers, the number of sinhala civilians killed is multiple times smaller than the tamil civilians killed, and that's a fact.

my father served in the SLA from 1996-2005, he's always said warcrimes happened, and he's said whenever the LTTE did some atrocity, tamils across the island would be deathly afraid of either mob violence or the SLA retaliating in the form of a tamil massacre.",17,/r/srilanka/comments/1lvww5h/body_count_at_chemmani_is_now_at_56/n2c1tsj/,1752140004.0

there's also getting intel, some tamils may be more knowledgeable about the LTTE movements than the army intelligence, so the army would torture and subsequently kill tamil civilians to get intel. also a common practice during the civil war.

what we know DEFINITELY happened is that dozens of bodies are found, which corroborates with a officers confession from 1998, and local testimonies from that time. giving very high likelihood the SLA did this. wether it was a massacre or gradual disappearance is another matter.

2. what resources? these bodies were buried skin deep, barely 2 feet underground. all you need is a group of people shovelling for a few days. maybe a bulldozer. all of which the army has plenty of access to.

he was convicted for the rape of a 18 year old school girl, and half a dozen others were convicted to death or prison for the torture, mutilation and murder of the girl's family, father, mother, brother were all found mutilated and murdered.

the grand mother in the story went to meet the rapist officer in prison, to see if she can get supportive testimony for a completely separate case to free her grandson. the rapist officer(either out of guilt, or redemption) gave her a letter exposing that 300-400 bodies were buried at chemmani by the SL army.

not by me. 

>can i ask whether u are a ltte supporter/separatist?

yes you can, and no i am absolutely not a LTTE supporter. 

ive supported a united state from the age i was first able to form my own opinion, and ive directly lost family members to the LTTE,  so i am absolutely and wholly against the LTTE

that being said, what differentiates me with a lot of other sri lankans is i am not an ethno/sinhala nationalist, i am a civic nationalist, and therefore i have a much more balanced view of the conflict, so naturally my views clash with other Sinhalese. i hold a ""sri lankan before sinhala/tamil/muslim"" mindset. so i don't expect a lot of people to see eye to eye with me.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1lvww5h/body_count_at_chemmani_is_now_at_56/n2jqufl/,1752241277.0

people don't refer to me by my birth name, i have a nick name that's nothing like my birth name. there are many reasons people can be referred to as differently than their birth name. 

the fact is the officer (under whatever name) slipped this letter, addressed to the grand mother who came to find any supporting testimony for a completely separate case.",5,/r/srilanka/comments/1lvww5h/body_count_at_chemmani_is_now_at_56/n2c7wpe/,1752143274.0

- keep the run rate going even wicket falls. In the past we have never seen that. 
- didn't pressurized after quick wickets fallen.
- instead of one or two man. All of batsmen contributed to the total. 
- super energy in the field.
- less mistake in the field. 
- using balling variations. Slow balls, clutters etc. 

Way to go boys way to go. Let's bring the WC. Congratulations !

Edit- another improvement.

xbp6mc,,comment,"The main takeaways from this tournament are Kusal Mendis' and Rajapakse's newfound form in t20is. Rajapakse averages like 70 this asia cup. He has a floating role, and is able to build an innings or slog at the death. He is the most vital batsmen in our team, because as this asia cup showed, if others fail he can still get it on, as his role overlaps with death powerhitters as well as top order accumulators. Moreover Kusal Mendis upping his strike rate as an opener is glorious and pairs really well with Nissanka's measured approach.

This new fearless cricket is what SL really needed, this is what SL have always been about since we started playing. 

Dds played some brilliant shots like friggin A\* drives, but im still not sure if he's the right man in the t20 wc in Aus with big boundaries. I want to see Asalanka back in form hopefully, since dds cant bowl spin overs in Aus.

Hasaranga was able to get wickets this match due to the run rate pressure, thats where he does best, when he's got a nice score to defend. My issue is that he hasnt been that good against the other sides. He needs to use his legspinner more often cos batsmen will just defend the googly otherwise.

Anyways I need not point out the good captaincy by Dasun Shanaka who's had to really learn a lot on the job. You can see his evolution from 2021 wc to nowadays, he's far more mature.

So they can surely comment on this topic very much. I haven’t travelled to that many countries either. But from what I experienced then and my limited experience in aerial/drone photography I can comment reasonably as well.

However one thing to clear: This doesn’t mean majority of Sri Lankans living abroad know what it’s like on the ground in Sri Lanka, an intimate knowledge of the social, environmental and emotional drama/turmoil beneath those clouds. Their perspective is skewed by viewing Sri Lanka through a Western Lens.

The middle 60 percent of the households generated an average monthly income of Rs.56, 079 for a family of 3.7 persons.""


Let's be honest we can blame our politicians for their greed, but at the end of the day, it's the ppl that vote for a bottle of liquor or pay a commission to get a tender.

Lots of ppl seem to be anti taxes because of ""corruption"". The funny thing is that even if we didn't have corruption, ppl would still be against taxes at the end of the day they are as greedy as the politicians. 

No politicians would ever be elected if they said they were raising taxes. Gota got the Colombo crowds votes because he cut their taxes. 

The ppl of this country are no different than the politicians we elect to represent us.

Would you vote for someone that promised to raise your taxes and give it to the lowest income 20% of households ? Be honest 90% of you would be against it. Hell, even I wouldn't be thrilled about it.

10kns91,,comment,"You do realize that inflation is at 60 percent? Other developed nations are freaking out at inflation getting to 10 percent and here we are dealing with rates at 6x that.

With the cost of living sky rocketing, you can't blame people for not wanting to pay taxes. I am sure that people won't mind paying if it meant things will get better in the future. But we all know that is not going to happen.

Politicians can't steal from the government coffers so they are taking from people. How can people live? Let alone do other things such as buy a car or even get married? We can't keep our lives on hold waiting for a resolution that will never come.

I sympathise with anyone who doesn't want to pay taxes. We should also stop these pick-and-choose comparisons with developed countries. The income tax might be higher but the value of what people earn is much higher, the cost of living is more affordable, and the quality life better.",23,/r/srilanka/comments/10kns91/the_reason_sri_lanka_will_never_progress_and_that/j5sfrq9/,1674626468.0
10kns91,,comment,"So my parents are doctors and we pay income taxes. Wouldn’t say how much but it’s a lot. Even though we have declared all our assets and payed our due without any delay at all, they STILL try to find SOMETHING they could use to get more money. And basically, going to answer their questions is about the same as an interrogation.

Additionally, the tax process of our country is very complicated and hard for a laymen to understand, which isn’t the case with other so-called “developed” countries.

Plus, my parents also get taxes cut off their salaries in ADDITION to the income tax. The amount cut isn’t small.

This is why many government professionals are against increasing taxes.

Not to mention the fact that the government has implemented a lot of circular taxes, which is why many of the things in your neighborhood supermarket have become eye-wateringly expensive.

But yeah, the truth is most of the people in this country didn’t and don’t pay taxes. The government always took taxes from their employees, but not from rest of the general population. Whenever they needed some more cash, they always took from the people working for them. Many private businessmen would earn much, much more, and they wouldn’t give a cent to the government, nor would the government ask them too.

And yes, the government never did anything in return for the money they took. Nor will they. The government today is the same as the government yesterday. Increasing taxes is good and yeah our people don’t like to pay shit, but can you trust the people at the top with your money? Plus, it was they who decided to install the broken tax system in the first place. They are responsible. So are we for installing them. So is every Sri Lankan since independence who allowed things to get this bad.

Taxes are necessary. But so are other means of income necessarily to keep the boat floating. Trying to fill the country’s coffers just with taxes is like removing a wood board from the boat to repair a hole in the boat.

Another reason is that with globalization people have started to compare their salaries with salaries elsewhere in other countries.

10kns91,,comment,"lol this is such horeshit from both you u/TriAlpha and Bhanoob, props to the govt for successfully managing to pit working professionals against each other, they seem to actually be succeeding while scaring away our talent

Let's see the real context:

* The entire debate from the pro-Ranil side (because that's what it really is) completely ignores that **many people are fine with tax just not to the Rajapaksa govt** (yes Ranil is a part of that). Bhanuka completely avoids the possibility that his team member simply doesn't want to pay tax to a Rajapaksa govt. This tax debate is an attempt to legitimize Ranil's govt and its going to backfire on us really hard.
* We have already seen them not use our tax money wisely, they ruined the country but even now they raised the defence budget while decreasing the health + food security budget. Addressing corruption absolutely must come first before taxes but these people are trying to convince you that we can skip solving corruption which is actually how we got to this mess in the first place. So this whole ""you can hold them accountable with tax"" argument is complete bullshit
* Assuming we do pay tax to this current govt, then what? We know they're very likely to continue corruption and wasting it and when that does happen then what? Do we hold people like OP accountable? When they use the higher tax to further increase the military budget how will we even protest?
* u/TriAlpha is someone who is consistently pushing whatever Ranil's agenda is at the time, right now that's pitting actual working professionals against each other to shift blame from the govt, and its working, we still have no actual attempt to fix corruption despite it easily being one of the biggest issues
* Using income brackets is an attempt to paint the debate black & white when really the very idea of ""middle-class"" is a grey area in SL. Just because the govt has managed to keep 80% of Sri Lanka poor doesn't mean that earning $500 is ultra-rich. It doesn't make you ultra-poor either but to frame the top 10% as anyone earning 100k+ here and then acting like they are the owners of corporations and part of the 1% elite is disingenuous
* You can be pro-tax but not for this government, the tax debate isn't some armchair black and white thing, you absolutely must take context. I'm pro-tax but no one has been able to justify why the fuck anyone should pay tax to a Rajapaksa govt
* Corporate tax is still cut, if you want to get immediate tax right now look to corporate tax because they owe it to us after their cuts ruined the country, while the middle-class was the only thing keeping this place developed.
* Bhanuka himself earns a ton of money and if income bracket tax suffices he'd proportionally be favored because the taxes disproportionally affect middle-income brackets. If he earns 2 mil while someone earns 1 mil, his tax is far easier to manage. Bhanuka is no shining beacon of philanthropy lmao, he is very much part of the same techbro startup culture that is absolutely failing to keep our programmers here.

10kns91,,comment,Exactly! I was actually going to mention that in my comment as well. People who earn a foreign currency or work with foreign clients expect to be compensated equally. But again they miss the point and want an exactly equal salary without thinking of the cost of living or local tax structures. You cannot earn an equal amount when you're living in a country with a fraction of the cost of living and taxes like ours. However if you compare that salary with other local salaries it is at a more than equal level to what an engineer from the foreign country would earn if they were living and working in that foreign country itself.,26,/r/srilanka/comments/10kns91/the_reason_sri_lanka_will_never_progress_and_that/j5s3dze/,1674619517.0

Well they're part of the tax and 100k-1mil disproportionately are getting taxed comparatively. Why are you ignoring that??

This is the problem, this is a narrative that is only vaguely true and misses a huge amount of context, you probably saw those tax:GDP charts right? Well the same people pushing those charts don't show you our GDP:Military:Education:Health ratios either.

Which comes to your second point (why we can't do both), we can't do both because reforming the govt and dealing with corruption comes first and we're not even dealing with corruption so we're not doing both to begin with. No country is perfectly free from corruption but there is clearly a certain level where no matter what you do its next to impossible to develop the country with rampant corruption, higher taxes not only doesn't deal with that issue but it give even less incentive for them to be accountable. How does giving Mahinda free money make him accountable? The proof of this argument is that despite so much push-back on taxes the govt STILL increased the military budget and decreased the health + food security budget, we saw right away that the ""tax will make them accountable"" argument was not true.

I'd suggest reading up on Botswana, a country which had a mildly similar situation which managed to transform to one of the fastest developing African countries in the world, they consistently mention dealing with corruption as one of the main reasons for this.

Yes, a single programmer earning 1mil+ acting like they are suffering as much as burnt out doctors raising a family on 200k is BS and yes you do get bro-types who are anti-tax in general, but how do we know that Bhanuka wasn't taking this guy's comments out of context?

They already have jobs, this is the mentality I'm talking about. You don't give a shit about the people, you're only concerned about Ranil winning, some guy you've never met also.

Have you ever been outside Sri Lanka? The arrogance is funny because you talk like other countries are as bad as SL. Oh shit 200k educated software engineers got laid off from fortune 500 companies, so what? No programmer gives a shit lmao, you know there's thousands of companies outside fortune 500 right? If you got laid off from a Fortune 500 company your life is still on top, if you stayed in Sri Lanka as a programmer though your best bet is to earn $2000 a month while a basic HTML coder earns the same amount in another country.

Yes many go to the ME but brain drain is a factual thing even before the crisis and along with people going to the ME the brain drain from middle-income professionals also has accelerated since covid and since the economic crisis.

Sri Lanka needs professionals, not the other way round no matter how many mental gymnastics anyone tries. We're a bankrupt country and tax is just the icing on an already shit cake, a country which isn't addressing the actual root problems and instead is now telling people like doctors (who burnt out the most last few years) that they need to give even more money to the same govt, its a slap in the face when we have 0 signs of accountability or progress. Instead we have a bunch of broke Colombo young adults with good intentions trying to tell people actually earning money what to do with their money, most people on this sub are living off their parents money so its easy for them to be pro-tax (refer to the numerous salary and age threads).

I'm sure you could go to most high-end tech companies here and they'll tell you how many staff are leaving, I saw a post from a nurse about how 1/4 of of their staff have already left.

If raising taxes reduces or stops the printing of money, that's all I care about. Less money printed = less inflation.

To me, effect use of the taxes means the government uses the money to fund the government expenditures without having to print money to cover the short fall. It's pretty simple  

The government doesn't make enough cash, so it prints money to cover deficit. If new taxes move, the needle will reduce the inflationary pressure of money printing. That's the effect use of taxes. 

Now you can disagree that's up to you, but to me, that's a great step towards recovery, lol.

Stop deflecting the question and actually answer it. Why would THIS govt be accountable with our tax money? I + many others, again, are NOT AGAINST TAX we are against a CORRUPT GOVT using it. Inflation is still happening and predicted to stay in the double digits for the rest of this year while the Rajapaksa's stolen assets alone are said to equal the IMF bailout, why should working professionals be burdened with the money already stolen from our govt?

Maybe an easier way to explain this is, if a Mahinda supporter told me during Mahinda's time that Mahinda needs higher taxes and he'll put it to good use, you'd be skeptical right? This time is not only similar but even worse because the ones paying the tax aren't the ones who got us here, most of them didn't even vote Rajapaksa and now they are paying for their crimes while they STILL are in parliament",1,/r/srilanka/comments/10kns91/the_reason_sri_lanka_will_never_progress_and_that/j5y0hr2/,1674727362.0

You're living in a dream world where everything is based on right and wrong, good and bad.

In a dream world, MR would have been arrested for corruption in 2015, and Gota would have been arrested for war crimes in 2010. Instead, our ppl gave them an overwhelming mandate in the last election.

My point is Rajapakses corruption was soo fucking obvious we all knew it for years, in reality 90% of the funds they stole were between 2005 -2015, thsi time there wasnt much for them to work with. but still ppl voted for them because they promised then less taxes and more friendly regulation in 2019 

The ppl didn't care if the Rajapakses stole as long as they got something out of it as well.  How else do you explain why they got soo many fucking votes ?


>Stop deflecting the question and actually answer it. Why would THIS govt be accountable with our tax money? I + many others, again, are NOT AGAINST TAX we are against a CORRUPT GOVT using it.


Look, every government in LK has been corrupt, and any future one will also be corrupt. In a ideal world we raise taxes and cut down spending drastically.

We should cut down our bloated public sector, sell off loss making SOEs, and get rid of half the army but these things will never happen no matter how much I want them to.

For one these things can't happen overnight. For example, it takes at least 5 years to cut the army in half on a realistic time scale. But not a single political party in the entire country is for cutting defense or cutting the public sector for a very simple reason. 

Because they would lose votes. I can keep dreaming about these things happening but in reality it's highly unlikely to ever happen. No matter who is in power. SJB,UNP,SLPP,SLFP,JVP,TNA, it doesn't matter. None of them will do what's necessary. Hence, they will all be corrupt and working for their own interests.

That's why I'm settling for less inflation because I know no matter who's elected, the story may be different but not the tune. 

So let me put the question to you, how do you know that another won't be as corrupt or even more than this one ?

Corruption is in Sri Lankan Nature unfortunately,

The real issue is the tiny group of troublemakers (excluding the usual suspects,  politicians and their henchmen) who thrive on stirring chaos and fueling ethnic tensions for their own amusement or benefit. Thanks to social media, their voices get amplified way beyond what they deserve, and their nonsense ends up sparking real disruptions.

As ordinary people who just want to live peacefully and get along with everyone, we have a responsibility.

That is the system will treat you like a black person. For example, Toronto school board came up with a three strikes you are out policy for high school kids. After 5 years of its implementation someone did a study and found out blacks, Filipinos and Sri Lankan kids were more prone to be expelled for minor infractions by the white administration than white, North Indian, Pakistani and Chinese kids.

The sad reality is Blacks and Sri Lankans (not sure about filipinos) are more involved in gangs and youth crime... Sri lankans, though not so much any more, had a well-earned reputation in the 90s and early 2000 for violent gangs. It's cleaned up a lot, but it's easy to tear a reputation apart, and much harder to rebuild it.

Instead of blaming others, lets take responsibility for ourselves and continue to do well as a community.

As for this book, many Canadians (in cities) know Sri Lankans and know we're not black. It seems like an honest mistake or they're just categorizing it into the 'minority' sectio.

There’s about 30 IMAX 70mm in the world yes, but these are massive stadium like cinemas and even India failed to bring down a 70mm IMAX because people didn’t go cuz of how expensive it was. 

That aside this is a real IMAX in Sri Lanka we have, so be happy about it.

The difference of a LieMAX and an IMAX is simple - the aspect ratio and the projection.  LieMax is when an old cinema is renovated to an IMAX with the usual aspect ratio with the panaromic view and these type of LieMAX cinemas mostly use 2K projection. 

HCM IMAX was planned way back and the mall was architected to fit an IMAX and I did watch Deadpool and Wolverine last night to confirm it is indeed a real IMAX(Deadpool is not an IMAX movie so there were black borders on top and bottom but they used the borders to put 3D effects to make things feel like its coming out the screen).

So basically if the cinema does not have the aspect ratio of an IMAX, it’s a LieMAX.",24,/r/srilanka/comments/1eddarg/imax_broke_down_middle_of_the_movie/lf749y7/,1722092646.0

at that time i Badly wanted to become a Soldier. as kid i always wear a Camouflage t-shirt, trousers, Coat or at-least a cap. even my uncle gifted me a long sleeve Camouflage t-shirt. 

i still watch the old videos of our fighters in the battlefield liquidating enemies and their positions still makes me respect them. happy things ended in 2009 by the grace of God.

Sri Lanka’s 2025 budget has allocated a staggering LKR 437 billion to defence spending—an increase of LKR 12 billion from the 2024 revised estimates, despite the island’s ongoing economic struggles. For comparison our Healthcare budget is 479 Billion. Our defence budget is steadily on the rise eversince the end of civil war. 

Do you want to keep the inflated military and spend more and more for defence while majority of people are struggling for 3 meals a day?

There is a saying its more difficult to maintain peace than to win a war. Its cheaper to prevent a war with a strong defense force than to win one costing the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. A strong defense force is a must for a country like Sri Lanka as there are still Tamils in South India wanting to see a separate state in Sri Lanka. It was Indian RAW that created and funded the LTTE to subdue us to their will. They did it once. What guarantee they wont do it again or send the Indian Army to Sri Lanka because our Army was too small back then? AKD reduced the Army to 100000 the AF to 18000 and Navy to 40000. There's barely any fighting force left as this number also includes non combat personnel like cooks, band members, and car drivers for big wigs. Only manpower was holding our military tougher. We do not have sophisticated weapons like western nations to reduce the forces to their level.  If AKD had genuine intentions about our defense he should have augmented the heavy weaponry first to counteract the reduction in forces. Did he? That's the proper way to reduce the forces of a nation. AF crashed a multimillion dollar jet right after they were reduced. Money we spent on forces did not leave the country. It was mostly salaries which helps to stimulate the economy when they buy goods and services from their pay check. Spending on forces is part of government fiscal policy to bring the country towards full employment. Russian economy did great even under western sanctions when they spent on their defense. Even Singapore spends 10 times more money than us on their defense being a country size of Colombo without facing any threats from surrounding nations while we still have separatist forces acting inside the country promoting LTTE propaganda in North.",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1jyraue/how_sri_lankan_soldiers_celebrated_the_new_year/mn1itu5/,1744628506.0

1jyraue,,comment,"\>Canada and Greenland is worried about getting annexed by US because they barely have a military

in 2023 canada spent US$27.2 billion, which is around 5x sri lankas ENTIRE national budget, saying ""they barely have military"" is just retarded. 

and greenland has the entirety of the EU backing it, not just denmark, it is firmly a part of the EU, and they recently dedicated 1 TRILLION euros to hyper-militarize. 

its safe to say, greenland and canada aren't that worried about being annexed.

\>They probably used your argument to water down the military now regretting because they cant expand the military that fast

and they achieved some of the worlds highest quality of life for their citizens, haven't been at war since the end of ww2, and at the same time they've actually maintained very decent and modern militaries. their militaries aren't ""watered down"", if we were up against france, germany, or a balkan country(estonia, latvia, lithuania) we'd be absolutely thumped, even though our military is bigger. the reason is tech, we need to cut down on personnel and invest in R&D + acquiring new tech, not simply just maintaining an expensive standing army. theres nuance.

\> India annexed Goa using their military

we are not a small pocket colony of land, we are a sovereign nation, with international backing, and a UN seat.

\> they can do it again at a time of crisis which is inevitable in a country like Sri Lanka at some point

no, that was how much we spent on the military THIS YEAR.

\>A strong defense force is a must for a country like Sri Lanka as there are still Tamils in South India wanting to see a separate state in Sri Lanka.

we can have a strong defense force without spending 450B lkr

\>AKD reduced the Army to 100000 the AF to 18000 and Navy to 40000

are you fucking retarded, he didnt reduce anything, he ordered them to stop recruiting, which means over time people will naturally retire, and end their service, so it'll be a slow, gradual decrease in size and spending. we still have 346,000 active service personal, and 90,000 in reserves.

if shit hits the fan we can mobilise hundreds of thousands within weeks, theres no sound reason to spend so much money on a standing army larger than germany and france combined.

Just because this racist government sponsored monk spread racism don't be another racist for your race. 

Of course there are politician monks, monks political henchmen even mahanayakas ..those are useless anyway! ..But that doesn't mean they all are in the same territory. There are genuine Buddhist monks who actually spread Buddha's teachings and peace. Not only in Sri Lanka in world wide genuine Theravada Buddhist monks practice their stuff. Do not abridge everyone is same. It the same when people abridge all Muslims are terrorists and all Tamils are LTTE terrorists. That's just insane and inhumane.

And let’s not forget his unprecedented high-interest loans during 2015–2019, many still unpaid, which directly slowed growth:
https://lankatruth.com/en/?p=20952

This post tries to paint AKD as “anti-IMF” when that’s just false. Before the September 2024 election, AKD repeatedly said Sri Lanka cannot exit the IMF program, only renegotiate for fairer terms.

20 Aug 2024 (Daily News): “There is no possibility of immediately withdrawing from the IMF agreement; an NPP govt would seek to amend certain clauses.”

27 Aug 2024 (Ada Derana): “We can’t come out from the IMF program… we’ll uphold the agreement while negotiating relief for the people.”  https://www.adaderana.lk/news.php?nid=101549

4–5 Sept 2024 (The Island / NewsFirst): “No unilateral exit”; NPP will meet the fiscal and debt-ratio targets, while making space for social protections.

16–18 Sept 2024 (The Island): If renegotiations for a better DSA drag on or prove costly, the NPP would adhere to the existing DSA.

15 Dec 2023 (The Morning - Harini Amarasuriya, NPP MP): “With the IMF, we’ll negotiate in the public’s best interest with transparency.”

Meetings with IMF staff: NPP Met with IMF staff in Colombo pre-election, raising debt-relief concerns which is exactly what you’d expect from a serious, responsible party. This was huge news back in the day when people said that the IMF knows that Anura is winning the election. 

Anyway, AKD’s position was never “quit IMF.” It was to continue the program, negotiate better terms, and protect the people. That is the exact opposite of Gotabaya’s reckless policies.

Meanwhile, Ranil’s record speaks for itself:

2015–19 growth collapse.

Bond scam cover-ups and opaque debt deals.

Heavy reliance on short-term borrowing without structural fixes.

So let’s not act like Sri Lanka was “saved” by Ranil. The economy was already fragile because of decisions made under his watch. AKD/NPP’s approach is IMF compliant but people-focused, which is far more credible than the tired UNP playbook. Although their promises to negotiate weren't as great as they've hoped they still managed to,
secured a new staff-level agreement unlocking the 4th tranche of IMF funds (≈ $333–344 million) to keep reforms on track without default risk, negotiated flexibility in social spending, ensuring that fiscal targets leave space for health, education, and welfare budgets instead of blind austerity. I know Ranilists hate social spending but the NPP promised this to the people, so it is what it is, expanded Aswesuma (the cash transfer program) by working with the IMF to cover more families and raise benefit levels, protecting the poorest from the harshest cuts, pushed for a fairer Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), arguing for restructuring terms that don’t suffocate the economy or small businesses, launched a debt audit + transparent creditor talks, so people actually see where the money went and how restructuring is handled, insisted on inclusive policymaking by moving away from “closed-door” Ranil-style deals to open consultations with unions, professionals, and civil groups, kept the IMF program alive while pushing for fairness, proving that “responsible reform + people-first policy” can go hand-in-hand.


So not only is the “AKD would’ve ruined the economy” claim baseless, the reality is the NPP managed to negotiate terms that blend IMF compliance with social protection. That’s exactly what they promised before the election and exactly what they’re delivering now.


This post that “AKD would’ve ruined the economy” is built on feelings, not facts. His stated, documented policy = stick with IMF, renegotiate for fairness.

Yes AKD was “Anti-IMF” until it was inconvenient then flipped on a dime. By August 2024, It was very obvious that the IMF program was working and the general public thought so as well. So once again he took the politically “Popular” policy.

Ranil had the “balls” to take that decision in 2022 when it was politically unpopular but he knew was right! This clip was from 2023.

If you look at “AKD” throughout his life, he always took the politically popular decision instead of thinking whether they are accurate or not.

The IMF delegation met President Gotabaya Rajapaksa at the President’s House in Colombo on June 24, 2022, kicking off formal discussions for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) long before Ranil stepped in. 

The IMF team continued dialogue through June 20–30, 2022, concluding a productive staff-level visit while Gota was still in power.

On April 8, 2022, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa officially appointed Nandalal Weerasinghe as the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 

Later, on June 30, 2022, Gota re-appointed him for a six-year term, extending his services specifically to steer the IMF negotiations.

Nandalal who was the key central banker was installed and empowered by Gotabaya himself, not Ranil.

Ranil just waltzed in after the engine was already running, inheriting a crisis situation already in motion.

1myywt7,,comment,"He didn't take the path in 2022. The path was taken before him. And he didn't in 2017-18 when the GDP growth was tanked. 

I just showed you the history where GOTA brought in the IMF and started the first IMF hearings post-crisis, as well as reinstalling Nandalal.  Now let's go back to the 2015–19 period, the IMF was already knocking on Sri Lanka’s door ready to provide support, thanks to Ranil's poor economic management that tanked the GPD growth to a war-time low from 5% to 2%.

Ranil, despite being PM, dragged his feet. He avoided committing to IMF programs because he feared the political backlash from necessary reforms, things like floating the rupee, raising taxes, and cutting subsidies. Things you mentioned that require BALLS. The IMF even suspended talks in 2019 because the government wasn’t implementing agreed reforms (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Sri-Lanka-Staff-Report-for-the-2016-Article-IV-Consultation-and-Request-for-a-Three-Year-43960). 

Meanwhile as much as it hurts to say, Gota, when the real crisis hit in 2022, engaged with the IMF (albeit reluctantly at first) and got the process moving, which ultimately allowed the country to stabilize once Wickremesinghe took over. So don’t give me the fairy tale about ‘courage’. Ranil had the chance, he just didn’t act. If Ranil at least followed the IMF before 2019, then we wouldn't have hit a crisis due to Rajapaksa corruption, Covid and taking bad economic decisions because then we would have backups and a return back to an economic growth above the 2% mark before 2019.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1myywt7/sl_wouldve_been_ruined_if_akd_took_power_in_2022/nagg4na/,1756061105.0

1myywt7,,comment,"Once again you’re making classic logical errors in your argument. The fact of the matter was when SL closed down for covid and our tourism coffered dried up it was clearly obvious that we were going to default. Gota at that time had two options. Negotiate with the IMF and get a bailout (the right thing to do at the time) or keep on bugging our friends nations for loans and wait for  the economy to be in full swing after covid easing around the world ( hoping tourism will come back)

Gota did not like the IMF bailout because just like AKD, Gota was a populist president who knew if he went to the IMF he would have to reform the structure of the economy and balance the he budget. That would mean implementing new taxes, free floating the rupee instead of artificially keeping it low and others.

Both AKD and Gota did not have the “balls” to take politically unpopular pragmatic decisions. Only Ranil did.

Thus Gota worsened the crisis, AKD would probably have been paralyzed at the wheel as well because he would lose majority support if he took unpopular correct policy decisions. These statements that he made during that time is a testament to how bad a president he would have been if he took power in 2022.

Let's go back to the 2015–19 period, the IMF was already knocking on Sri Lanka’s door ready to provide support, thanks to Ranil's poor economic management that tanked the GPD growth to a war-time low from 5% to 2%.

Ranil, despite being PM, dragged his feet. He avoided committing to IMF programs because he feared the political backlash from necessary reforms, things like floating the rupee, raising taxes, and cutting subsidies. Things you mentioned that require BALLS. The IMF even suspended talks in 2019 because the government wasn’t implementing agreed reforms (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2016/12/31/Sri-Lanka-Staff-Report-for-the-2016-Article-IV-Consultation-and-Request-for-a-Three-Year-43960). 

Meanwhile as much as it hurts to say, Gota, when the real crisis hit in 2022, engaged with the IMF (albeit reluctantly at first) and got the process moving, which ultimately allowed the country to stabilize once Wickremesinghe took over. So don’t give me the fairy tale about ‘courage’. Ranil had the chance, he just didn’t act. If Ranil at least followed the IMF before 2019 using his apparently never used BOG BALLS, then we wouldn't have hit a crisis due to Rajapaksa corruption, Covid and taking bad economic decisions because then we would have backups and a return back to an economic growth above the 2% mark before 2019.",7,/r/srilanka/comments/1myywt7/sl_wouldve_been_ruined_if_akd_took_power_in_2022/nagb09p/,1756059499.0

He also took out loans with really high interest and didn't pay them back in his tenure from 2015-19 and tanked the annual GDP growth from 5% to 2%.

If the party that ran the country for 60% of Sri Lankan history isn't the Yapping party then what is? Oh well now it's the joint opposition. Every party except for the NPP are certified yapping parties, now a single party. For the amount they yapped, if they did 5% of the things they yapped, Sri Lanka would at least have become a Thailand.

In this video 25 things out of 500 proposals are mentioned. Proposals from the 2015-29 Ranil government. None of them have been done. NPP has already done 6 of them in 9 months and 4 are upcoming.

You're missing the core point. My argument isn't that the IMF didn't suspend loan disbursements during the 2018 political crisis. It's about why the program was already so behind schedule for two and a half years before that crisis even started.

Compare that to the 2022 IMF program. Gota's government, and then the following two presidents, have managed to get far more done in a shorter period. The IMF reviews have progressed much more smoothly because, despite the political changes, the governments have been committed to executing the reforms.

https://numbers.lk/analysis/sri-lanka-local-government-election-2025-numbers-lk-poll-shows-npp-leading-with-nearly-two-thirds-of-national-vote

Note that local government elections are different and that people vote the individual in LG elections and there's also a low voter count. There are tons of parties and independents that you wouldn't see in any other election. And also that PS members have better reputations than parliamentary members, MPs and Presidents due to close associations with the county locals. With all that, it's difficult to poll a local government election. That's why numbers.lk polls for both the presidential and parliamentary elections ended up within the 5%+/- margin but the LG elections didn't.

This 62% mark is even higher now since your politicians got together and formed alliances both after the LG elections and after the Ranil imprisonment.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1myywt7/sl_wouldve_been_ruined_if_akd_took_power_in_2022/nagjbqm/,1756062104.0

But not much done for 2 and a half years before all that. Compare that to what has been achieved with the IMF from 2022 with elections, 2 governments and 3 Presidents.

If the IMF suspended tanks now after being in Sri Lanka since 2022, we would have still gotten so much done. But since 2016, what did Ranil do with the IMF?

Fiscal Consolidation by reducing the budget deficit or 
public Financial Management by trying to improve how it managed public spending and financial reporting or sate Enterprise Reforms by putting state-owned enterprises on a more commercial footing doesn't need to involve the IMF.

1fmvfcl,,comment,"My opinion on what went wrong for him, he did in fact bring the country back from bankruptancy, but the way he did it is the issue. Taxes went nuts overnight from like 5k to 90k. Goods have tripled, VAT is implemented on unnecessary things such as books. Few of my friends who bought cars off loans had to sell cause of the massive tax hike overnight. 

Some say that the massive taxes were necessary then why did he suddenly change everything again overnight just 2 weeks before the election. Taxes were reduced, we got an announcement that vehicle imports are happening. 

The poor person who stood in lines to buy goods eventually could buy goods, but now they're not able to even afford it. They just skip and buy something else now. This is a wrong way of ending queues, I guess. 

The taxes he implemented and collected, it's gonna be used to pay debts and just run the roll again. No sort of transparency or future plans on how to make Sri Lanka sustainable for the future instead of just depending on tourism. I believe we need to produce and export way more and import less.

I feel like the reason we have the $ to buy goods now is mainly because we have stopped paying loans and no vehicle imports. Wonder what will happen when we have to start paying loans and projects start again.

Idk if I'm wrong but this is what I feel and see. I too had good respect for him, but I do see the problem.",30,/r/srilanka/comments/1fmvfcl/isnt_ranil_an_unsung_hero_i_mean_considering_the/lodktyy/,1727019987.0

1fmvfcl,,comment,"Anyone who says Ranil saved our currency lacks economic nuance. 

Ranil didn’t avoid the inevitable collapse by focusing on short-term fixes like austerity and IMF loans without addressing deeper structural issues in Sri Lanka’s economy. By prioritizing debt repayment over-investment in local industries and failing to tackle corruption and inefficiency, he missed the opportunity for sustainable growth. Most of his MPs are corrupted Pohottu MPs hated by the people. The reliance on foreign aid and international creditors may provide temporary stability, but as public discontent grows, and with no real economic reforms in place, the system will likely buckle under external shocks or increasing debt burdens. When the debt cycle restarts and austerity deepens, collapse becomes unavoidable. Ranil could have focused on wealth redistribution like what the UK Labor Party today is doing through re-nationalisation rather than relying solely on austerity and privatisation like the UK conservatives.

anil didn’t ‘save’ anything—he just kicked the can down the road and forced the people to bear the brunt of his so-called ‘economic reforms.’ He didn’t really save the currency; he just delayed the inevitable crash with a series of quick fixes that hit ordinary people the hardest.  
  
While Ranil’s actions may appear to have stabilized the Sri Lankan rupee in the short term, the underlying approach reveals a pattern of temporary fixes rather than sustainable economic reform.   
By prioritizing foreign exchange reserves and appeasing international creditors, the administration effectively ‘stabilized’ the currency on paper while squeezing the domestic economy.  
  
The IMF bailout, austerity, and brutal tax hikes were all designed to give the illusion of stability, while the average Sri Lankan continues to suffer. He inflated foreign reserves on paper by killing imports and jacking up interest rates, but people can barely afford basic necessities now. It’s classic Ranil—polish the numbers for international applause while ignoring the real pain on the ground. If this is ‘saving’ the currency, then it’s the people who are paying the price for his smoke-and-mirrors act.  
  
High interest rates and excessive taxation created a deflationary environment that stifled growth while cutting subsidies on essentials like fuel and electricity left the population struggling with rampant inflation. In essence, Wickremesinghe’s strategy relied more on managing optics and preserving elite interests than addressing the structural inefficiencies that have plagued the Sri Lankan economy for decades.",3,/r/srilanka/comments/1fmvfcl/isnt_ranil_an_unsung_hero_i_mean_considering_the/lodx5ao/,1727023695.0

Police provide inquiry update on alleged NPP military threatening video

A complaint has been lodged against an individual who participated in a political rally and threatened supporters of other parties through a video message. 

The 47 year old individual, a resident of Kiribathgoda is a former major of the Sri Lanka Army, Police said. 

Accordingly an investigation was launched into the complaint lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 7 by a member of Parliament, Police said.

The video in question had been referred to the Government Analyst to verify the voice of the individual, while he had also been summoned to the CID to record a statement. 

Several organisations had lodged complaints with the CID about the video in question, Police said in a statement. 

**Meanwhile, the National People’s Power in a media conference said that the video in question had been manipulated, with a fake voice added to the original footage.**

The Computer Crime Investigation Division is conducting further investigations. **(Newswire)**

1lmxm19,,comment,"Sri Lankan media often knows how to manipulate Sinhalese audiences to boost ratings, and Facebook pages focus more on impressions than integrity. Meanwhile, they rarely show genuine concern for what Tamils have endured. The recent discovery of the mass grave, for instance, has not received the empathy it deserves. Even the Muslim community grieves for Gaza, but many fellow Sri Lankans remain indifferent to the pain of Tamils. 

I’m speaking from the perspective of a civilian.

As a Tamil, I’m not in favor of including the Eelam map in the monument, but I fully support the idea of a monument itself — it should stand as a remembrance of those lost.

I came across an image on Facebook showing a fallen soldier’s skeleton with a caption: “In his final moments, he thought of his family and died for his country.” It broke my heart. He didn’t deserve such a fate. This war was a disaster created and fueled by politicians. Yet I don’t often see this same sense of grief or reflection from the Sinhalese community. It feels as if all who died in the war are seen only as LTTE, ignoring their humanity and the complexities of the conflict.",5,/r/srilanka/comments/1lmxm19/this_is_true_guys_sl_media_like_that/n0d1024/,1751174023.0
1lmxm19,,comment,"Sri Lanka’s mainstream media has long turned a blind eye to the war crimes committed by the army and government during the LTTE era. Yes, the LTTE was a brutal terrorist group responsible for countless atrocities and that’s undeniable. But as a state, the Sri Lankan government and military were held to a higher standard, and yet they committed horrific acts: mass killings, rapes, torture, and decisions that blatantly disregarded civilian lives.

These actions blurred the line between terrorist and state. For many, there was no difference. That’s why some still sympathize with the LTTE, not because they supported terror, but because they felt it was the only group that stood up for a community being treated as less than human.

It’s tragic how little of this is known or accepted among the general public. Most believe the government was 100% justified, unaware of the piles of r*ped women, mass graves, and untold horrors. If true justice were ever served, top government and military officials, even former presidents would be the first in line for prosecution. But that would be a political earthquake and a permanent stain on our national history. So it’s buried, while LTTE’s crimes are discussed endlessly(rightfully so).

The only way forward is to acknowledge the pain on both sides. We owe at least that much to the dead Tamil, Sinhalese, Muslim alike. We can’t undo the past, but we can choose not to whitewash it.",12,/r/srilanka/comments/1lmxm19/this_is_true_guys_sl_media_like_that/n0c1u1r/,1751158922.0

1lmxm19,,comment,"From what I've heard, there is obviously bias in Sri Lankan media because of the corrupt powerful people who have stuff they want to hide.

Remember, in 2019 at Jaffna University they built a monument to remember Tamil victims in the war and the police demolished it. The monument didn't even show the map like the monument in Canada and they didn't use the word ""genocide"". But they still demolished it. 

""The monument was knocked down on Friday, with UGC Chairman Sampath Amaratunge saying it was a threat to national unity in Sinhalese majority Sri Lanka. Public Security Minister Sarath Weerasekera said that ""no one will and should be allowed to commemorate dead terrorists"". - BBC article, I'll link it below. But did any Sri Lankan media cover this incident?

That's why I thought the outrage from some Sri Lankans on the Canadian monument was so hypocritical. Because some police won't even allow Tamil people to commemorate Tamil victims and they're upset they can't demolish the monument in Canada like they did in Jaffna.

You, the LTTE used to spread false news that Sinhalese are monsters when you held them captive in their villages and you're still doing that. But when te war was over Tamil people started to realise what you have been feeding their minds were utter lies.

If the LTTE were so innocent why did you have to bomb the temple of the tooth, central bank, air ports, buses, trains, etc? Did you find army camps in them?

Why did you have to kill people of your own because they just used their civil rights to vote in an election?

How about Rajiv Gandhi?

I went to a school where every religion was treated equal, and LTTE bombed eight of my friends in Colombo fort train station, that includes one Tamil as well. Why do you care, in desparate times you would send children to the war front.

By reading your comments I can understand you don't want to read and believe anything that I have shared with international reports not jist reports from Sinhalese, of how cruel LTTE used to kill any innocent lives that they come across to just support their evil propaganda. Regardless if its men, women, pregnant mothers, children, hell they wouldn't at least leave infants alive.

I come from a school where multicultural students including Tamils study as brothers and LTTE bombed our entire baseball team back then in fort railway station. Kids who didn't even turned 18 who went to play a baseball game, that included a Tamil kid too had to come in coffins because LTTE didn't leave at least kids alive.
This is just one instance. They bombed temples including the sacred tooth, central bank, trains and whatever they would think of killing thousands of innocents.

You are a moron to believe that LTTE are pure saints and Sri Lankan Army was the evil monster you think to be in your mind. The difference between you morons and us is that despite all the killings LTTE used to do we wouldn't be blaming the entire Tamil community  calling them monsters and spreading hatred for whatever sick propoganda you have in mind, and we understand that not all Tamils are not to blame and we live with Tamils with peace to this date and its only a minority to be blamed for all the wrong doings.

So go spread your hatred with similar alike minds because this will be the last time I will be commenting in this post. And no I will not be chatting with you because simply I have better things to do than proving a point with someone who sees one side of things and doesn't want to read anything that says otherwise.

I think it could be white people, Western countries, or Sri Lankan migrants.   


*Why?*   
Perhaps because their media or social platforms haven't covered Sri Lanka extensively, or because they've heard from some acquaintances that it's a poor country, or maybe because they've only been to undeveloped areas. Sri Lanka's economy is ranked 79th in the world, while India is ranked 4th and Nordic countries are ranked between 20th and 25th. Sri Lanka is not a poor country; it just has a corrupt system.

I'd say part of the reason these protests are going so well is because a lot of regular people are coming and the govt knows they can't do anything overly aggressive because of it.

And no I don't accept Rajapakses using their kids, because their political view is obviously wrong, this isn't one of those normal political events where its just people's opinions, this is literally every person vs the most obvious bad government. I think anyone with common sense knows that parading their kids for political purposes usually is bad because it comes down to opinion but this isn't about opinions, **some parents might be bringing them along because they have no choice but want to protest.**

And no, your argument that there are better ways to teach children politics, like what exactly? We've had years to do that and failed while at the same time we've taught children that corruption and lying and being submissive are normal (that's a fact). **Kids are getting a lot smarter faster and they are obviously exposed to what's going on right now so are you going to keep them in the dark about it or tell them the truth?**

u3bslq,,comment,"Bro parents came to Mirihana protest also with kids initially. You will never know when a protest will turn to violent or not due to desperation government to keep the power right now and there can be civilians with various mind sets. 

Regular people means people without a support of political party representing many layers of society and it doesn't necessarily have to have kids in a protest to be peaceful. It's not worth the risk to take kids to make a protest peaceful using them as human shield. As adults we need to be responsible when attending to keep the protest peaceful.

You can't have double standard like that bro. No kids to protest from any side because we don't know whether kids are supporting either with their consent or not. Yes, there can be few cases where parent is stucked with kids and no other option. Even that I discourage them to stay at home but if they think it's worth the take the risk, it's upto them. But more than that now bringing kids become a trend.

Yes there are better ways. Many people who fight in these protest have never went to a protest before. For example we had the freedom in our homes to learn what is right and wrong. Parents never asked to support any party or restricted our information sources. So here we are attending protests as adults and do campaign online.

Their parents have the right to decide on their kids until certain age, and there is nothing evil in bringing a child to the protest. 

Yeah Rajapakshas might pull off every stunt but I now have the confidence that Sri Lankans will not fall for the same trick anymore. Heck they even included small children during their election propoganda and canvassing.

You can't just think and say bayya parents will not bring kids for your sake of your argument. We need to be careful enough to make a bad precedent here.

Everyone holds Maithripala as an example of the failings of the govt he presided over, but the fact that he made these insane fuck ups and then also immediately allied with the Rajapakses after the latest presidential election, seems to show that Maithripala was an idiot who was simply manipulated by the Rajapakses so that the Rajapakses can come back to power.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/g2k72a/racist_policies_mar_covid19_mitigation/fnyc915/,1587358921.0

The reason the curfew and the lock down is helping is to curb it as much as possible. If SL didn't go into lock down there will be an overwhelming number of cases coming within a very short period of time that hospitals, medical faculties, available equipment is not enough to deal with. 

By slowing the spread through these precautions it helps Sri Lanka prepare as well as treat covid cases without the whole system being over flowed and over burdened.

what's the aim here? If you wanted a nice shot of a soldier with the flag we already have plenty of actual real photos of that

If you need the imagery for some illustrated series or something then you'd have to go in using Photoshop and fix the mistakes. I'm not an expert on SL military attire so I could be wrong with some of these but

* Cap should be red unless the guy is in the air force but if he was then the camo would have blue patches too
* Flag needs cleaning up, the lion's tail is connected to itself and its face looks like its so stoned it can't open its eyes. The top right corner is cut off in a weird way
* The gloves are questionable
* The gun is not a T56-2 (or basically the AK-47 variant we use), the gun itself is a bit nonsense (in that whenever AI tries to make detailed things like guns or engines you notice weirdness) and needs detailing to make it resemble something real
* The ""glossiness"" of AI images in general needs post-editing, the lighting and shading is too perfect and air-brushed looking, an easy way to fix this is to just use overlay some noise/grain on low opacity",5,/r/srilanka/comments/1h4rhix/how_about_this_ai_generated_image/m00n5h7/,1733136211.0

I don't know what you are smoking... In Canada, it cost over $900,000+ CAD (including facilities, teaching fees, etc.) in government funds to educate a ONE single medical doctor. An average salary of a Canadian is around $50,000 per YEAR. You do the math smart guy.

You are bitter because you were not smart enough to get good grades in A/L to attend government universities.

Also, again, tiny little country called Sri Lanka would have NO POWER or ZERO POWER in going after anyone in another country for money just because your system wants the money back. Maybe instead of being bitter about Sri Lankan Medical Doctors doing well in Western nations, you should improve your self-esteem and do something for yourself.

Like I said, I AGREE with your point that this maybe unethical for someone  to use the free education in Sri Lanka and then just leave without contributing back to Sri Lanka. But ethics should NOT infringe the human rights of anyone Period. If you guys don't sort that out, Sri Lanka will be a forever poor ""third world"".

Not trying to defend AKD and his government by any means here but these are some of my personal views on why the import restrictions should stay on for a little longer:

\- Less tax on vehicles in SL would mean every tom dick n harry will purchase a vehicle and out of which some would just buy for the sake of wanting one but not because they actually need it. (except for nuts like me who have absolute zero interest in vehicles or driving)  
\- Does our road network have the capacity to support this influx of new vehicles - No  
\- Will our fueling network/stores be able to support a massive influx of vehicles - I don't think so  
\- Is our vehicle registration department equipped/resourced well enough to handle a large number of vehicles - i don't think so.  
\- Do we have enough parking spaces in cities? - I don't think so.  
\- Are we equipped to deal with the increased impact to the air? - I do not think so.  
\- Will there be a significant improvement of productivity as a ratio of the actual dollars spent in importing the vehicles - I do not think so (at least if all tuks were replaced by cars?)  
\- Definite impact on dollar reserves

again, I am no smart ass and I do not have much of an idea of how these financial things work (average citizen here) but i feel it's good to hold off importing until next year at least.",18,/r/srilanka/comments/1k10q42/how_legit_is_this_very_troublesome_imo/mnik4lp/,1744854882.0

1k10q42,,comment,"I see. But the matter of allowing imports is not as black and white as you think. The decision to allow imports was influenced by a few factors, like the tax revenue it would generate and also the conditions imposed by the IMF, etc, if my understanding is correct. And I feel people in Sri Lanka have a fundamental right to be able to import a vehicle if they want to. So IMO, restricting imports is not the solution, but making the tax structure itself a barrier to importing a vehicle is something that is acceptable IMO, since that is what they have done here. The tax is so high, the influx of vehicles is not as high as people, and even the government was expecting.

Look at what Singapore is doing, they have similar issues when it comes to importing vehicles due to the country being a small country and the infrastructure limittions. But have they restricted the import of vehicles? No, their tax structure itself is the barrier to entry for most people.

I'm not sure of the IMF conditions regarding allowing vehicle imports tbh.

I whole-heartedly agree with this statement - ""So IMO, restricting imports is not the solution, but making the tax structure itself a barrier to importing a vehicle is something that is acceptable IMO, since that is what they have done here."" -  and this is exactly what I imply by saying ""curtailing imports"" as well.

1k10q42,,comment,"The way I understand it, the tax revenue generated by the government through vehicle imports does not offset the USD reserve decrease. And it's never supposed to do that as well. The only way we can increase the USD reserves is by increasing exports, remittances, tourism etc. And that is why this year, there is a cap of a maximum of 1 billion USD for vehicle imports.

But the revenue generated by vehicle imports via taxes is crucial for the budget of Sri Lanka for this year. That is how the government pays for things that they have planned, and this could be new infrastructure, maintenance of existing infrastructure, government salaries, and a whole lot more.

So it's not a matter of offsetting the USD reserves, it's a balancing act between allowing imports while trying to control the imports, and also increasing the government revenue.

I'm no expert as well, but this is how I understand this..",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1k10q42/how_legit_is_this_very_troublesome_imo/mnjiw9j/,1744870509.0
1k10q42,,comment,"I see! But do you think we could ""earn back"" that 1 billion USD (if it all gets spent) simply by exports? Will the imported vehicles contribute to this ""earn back"" process if at all?  
  
Does importing all kinds of vehicles justify spending 1 billion USD so that government could use the generated income for new infrastructure, maintenance of existing infrastructure, and government salaries? (i guess one could do the math and calculate the actual amount the government would receive if the entire 1 Bil USD is used) Are vehicle import taxes the largest chunk of LKR influx to the government coffers? There was an imports ban and somehow the government did manage to obtain the necessary money to carry continue doing what they do.

Oh and btw, i forgot about the solutions part. I feel right now, the increase in tax is good and the vehicle imports must definitely be controlled and restrictive. We definitely have to start exporting as you say, be it goods and/or services.  Us losing the number 2 position to India in tea exports is a wake-up call for the country to start diversifying rather than stick to the usual export norms. People seemed to have found profits in quite a few export areas such as coconut based products in the recent past, issue is we are running out of land and coconut cultivation is a long term business. So yeah, we gotta start innovating, need to add value to certain products that we are already exporting perhaps.

Singapore as you mention have an amazing way of working, which include how they have specialized in manufacturing tiny vehicle components that are of high value, and how they have made agriculture work in their favour inspite of being a tiny plot of land (they export high quality seeds to countries like Thailand and Indonesia for cultivation and obtain high quality vegetable imports as part of the payment for those seeds). Some Singaporeans that I managed to speak to mentioned how they plan not twice but 10 times even for a simple thing like a road repair and how they manage their resources.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1k10q42/how_legit_is_this_very_troublesome_imo/mnjqqnf/,1744875252.0
1k10q42,,comment,"No, we won't. Not at least in the short term. Exports, Tourism, and other aspects need to gradually increase over time, and it won't happen overnight. And of course large percentage of the vehicles would not contribute to earning back the lost USD reserves. We can't really expect to only allow imports that would contribute to the USD reserves. That will have long-term consequences, and we don't need that. IMO, what we need is balance and consistent monitoring to make changes quickly as needed.

Yes, as far as I know, tax revenue from vehicle imports are a large part of the government earnings, how they managed to get by without that tax revenue before was as far as I know is through the gradual recovery of the export businesses, tourism, remmitance and also the grants, loans received by Sri Lankas close allies and the IMF. But most of these need to be paid back at some point.

Your points regarding the solutions are 100% valid, and we can learn a thing or two from other countries about how proper planning and management of resources can help develop the country. But largely these are out of our hands, and we just need to wait and see if the current government does the right thing.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/1k10q42/how_legit_is_this_very_troublesome_imo/mnjs8um/,1744876190.0

Also LOL, you talk about our tax money going to ""run the country"". Please, our tax money goes towards buying Prados, E/S Classes and supporting the parasitic VIPs of our government. 

And the US, although they have a shitty healthcare system, their social security is great. Unemployment, Food Stamps and other systems are in place to help support their citizens who do not have an income. 

Disabled people are paid a monthly stipend. Obamacare. There's so many systems in place to which a US Citizens tax money goes towards. This is not only in place in the US, but many EU countries too. 

Their tax money goes towards actually helping their society, not towards paying their politicians lifestyles. I would rather pay more income taxes if we had this kind of a support system. 

iPhones are not a priority, but most necessities are important for the everyday person. In India, you have smartphones for dirt cheap. This is because India knows that people need these stuff to progress. Here, a useable smartphone will cost 40k and up, which is not something an average man can afford to pay. 

You make bad comparisons. Our public education is free, but when it comes to University, it's a joke. Most public uni students take ages to complete their degree because it's ridden with political or some other drama. 

Private Unis? I go to one and let me tell you, it's not cheap. Good education is expensive. The US is overpriced, but our private Unis are not affordable to our people either. I've seen my own friends struggle to pay for fees, and I do a cheaper Degree. 

And people do take loans here for education. While I agree the US is overpriced, Sri Lanka has no social security and our taxes, whether income or product based, all go for shitty purposes.

You say people become more lazy when provided with welfare, but where do you get that from?

[Unemployment Rate in Netherlands](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/figures/detail/80590eng)

The Netherlands has the best Social Security/Welfare system in the world, and even during a Pandemic, their unemployment rate was 3.1% in June of 2020.

The US,  is in the last 20 Countries of Social Security quality in the world, and their unemployment rate is nearly 3x of the Netherlands, being 8.4% in August of 2020. 

[US Unemployment Rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273909/seasonally-adjusted-monthly-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/)

If you think people become more lazy with a better welfare system, kindly show proof of that lol. Pulling stories out of thin air doesn't really make a good argument. 

Studies have shown and proven that communities do better with better support from a welfare system.

I did and the bias mods here deleted it! I posted a post here comparing how most USA 9/11 victims died because they could not pay medical bills not because of the attack itself while all Sri Lankan victims of terrorism have received medical care without charging their credit cards.

The mods deleted it saying I have no right to compare the USA in a bad light because my post violated their policies on how my comments MUST be based on Sri Lanka -related issues.

Yet you can post anything bad about Sri Lanka. LOL

**I bet if I make a post about what Olcott wrote here, it will get deleted by the mods.**

The PM would never dare speak of Christian and Catholic church child abuses in Italy and Vatican. The Europe will revolt if he did that.... But Italy would be happy to discuss how elephants used by Buddhist temples are bad.

88/89 was created and directed by UNP.

Not what Ranil, Hirinika or SLPP says, Real History . JVP started a peaceful (aragalaya like) movement which was turned violent by UNP.

Basically a person who just don't give a flying fuck about others (just like the people in JVP).

If we look at there e book which they have uploaded in there website if im right, the plan they have in mind is not going to work rn. Its simply not.  Its not there time to come to power rn. Might be in the next election. Its not very practical to change the CEO of a company in the middle of a crisis or when the company is improving little by little ( it should be a miracle if this country come out of this hole the very next day after the election, i mean JVPs testimonies are like that. They tryna make this dilusional paradice in 1 day). 

The best option now is to work together. Idk if its going to work. But in my opinion, if JVP is going to do what they are saying their going to do, they should have a peace talk with Ranil and both should work together.

We could have been living a good life in a country filled with resources but instead 1 in 3 children are suffering from malnutrition. The system has failed and you keep trying to keep them in power hoping for a miracle. How are y'all so gullible?

You agreeing or not wouldn't change that. It did start as a peaceful aragalaya. My parents and grandparents who believe the UNP narrative thought just like you. But we've seen how things really are, how actually the UNP instigated violence in 89/89 taking advantage of poor communication and media fluidity back then. We saw the efforts repeat with aragalaya. However aragalaya didn't turn violent to that extent but hope all Sri Lankans showed what they are capable of when treated like cattle .

Again 88/89 JVP contributed to violence when their peaceful campaign versus violently suppressed by UNP. 

Like I said don't believe me, Ranil or anyone. read why the protest started in 88/89, how UNP suppressed it and how they painted it with billo and batalanda.

The history is lost. If you look back to 2022 you saw how the government tried to inflict violence and accuse the protestors, due to social media playing an active role that plan was foiled. Now imagine if social media existed back in 88/89 what would be the truth then? JVP could have been the main culprits or the agenda of JR and Premadasa would have been exposed. But with the information that we have now both factions involved in that are wrong and cannot be justified. Fast forwarding to 2022 gota failed due to his stupid decisions and corruption and also paying off the loans without a proper plan which caused the economy to go downhill. What happened? People suffered and suffered until to a point where they became fed up and raised their voice and united against the government. You know what happened next. Gota stepped down (props to him for not resorting to violence against the protesters). People won and wanted a change, gota invited sajith and he refused the offer (maybe get was unsure or he wanted to be appointed by the vote of the public. Idk whats true) Anura was not invited(check gotas book as well which also clearly states that Anura was not invited and Anura has said he even sent letters but did not get a response) Ranil was then invited and now in the need of a president they called a vote in the parliament, contestants were Anura,dalas and ranil. Ranil won this (the competition was mainly between rw and dallas. Anura only got 3 votes xD) Ranil came in to power with the blessing of the members of the parliament (mind you the people said no to the entire government) what did ranil do? I’ll say it as simply as possible,  He stopped paying off the loans and the country saw a boom in tourism after covid which stabilized the economy to some extent not entirely because if you look around the prices are 3 times then it was a couple of years ago. Now this stability is temporary and only until we start paying off the loans again which is good if we have a plan to grow our economy by the time we have to repay but do you honestly think the economy would grow with this corruption? Npp has put out a lot of policies and they have a lot of capable people behind them supporting for this cause. I believe if the corruption could be wiped off the economy will improve. The leakages needs to be stopped. Commissions need to be stopped, many investors dont even come here because of this. The system change promised by NPP is the only hope that is left and if that change is made this country will start taking a turn for the better. I believe in that change.

I’ll ask one question as well. Apart from 88/89 accusations, have these people stolen anything? Have they misused their funds? If you have anything against them with proof I will agree with you. While doing that look around the other candidates and the people around them as well and ask yourself if they are not corrupt :)",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1fgdni6/for_those_who_suddenly_justify_the_8889_acts_of/ln7oin4/,1726384842.0

Such a shame it had to come to that. 

Over all my family experienced a lot of JVPs actions back then. I for one will never believe that the NPP has the possibility of changing who they are coz majority of that party is ex JVP. 

Let's see what it comes to.

It is true that we cannot be sure on any of the presidential candidates. but we must vote to a candidate who will be the best among the rest. We know how the other presidential candidates are declaring fantasy world to secure their portion of votes and we also know who are behind those presidential candidates and who are supporting. for once I think we must take courage and give our best hope that the NPP will produce how much required change that the country is desperately in need.

1fgdni6,,comment,"1. I have done some research on 1971 & 1988/89. But the history is blurred and I have not experienced it since I have not even born during that time. So while those governments back them should be held more responsible, we can't justify the damage done by JVP too. 

2. I haven't seen any clear genuine apology done by a prominent JVP member so far. They may have mentioned very lightly some thoughts here and there. But that's alright till long as they act good faith in the present. But I don't trust them with the speeches shown in footages like this. The Lal Kantha's speech in this footage was done in this august. So I have a fear they use NPP as a Trojan horse for JVP. But still it's alright people to vote them if they believe they will stick to NPP policy. But justifying blurred past cannot be accepted at all. And there had been no statement or action from Leader AKD regarding Lal Kantha's speech so far. 

Couple of FB shares? The problem is not that the person who originally posted it (who I even don't know). But it is about some of my same age friends who shared those posts and argued with their justifications when I commenting the same stance I stood here (they have declared openly to support NPP and as far as I know they don't have a reason to pretend NPP).

Nietzsche didn't believe in a personal god, not because he was anti-science like you but because he believed that there are no truths.

As long as it takes, economies good or bad doesn't last forever, it's up to the people of this country to make it a success not the responsibility of foreigner. On top of that, if the economy is not developing, you're solution is to become the subject of a foreign power who exploits nation for there wealth? your solution to not having a developed country is to be under a power that'll ensure that we won't be developed? help me understand the logic.

**""Does like Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand not exist in your world?""**

Hong Kong developed because of so many people coming in from Shanghai China not because of british. Singapore developed because Lee Kuan Yew, not because of a british. I dare you to go to the original inhabitants of australia and tell them that british colonization was a good thing for them, I'll happily watch from afar while they annihilate you. The natives of those countries had a brutal, bleak period after being colonized and you have the gall to talk about how great it was that those lands were colonized by british. It's great for the descendants of the british, go ask the natives if they feel the same. You're a prime example of those who don't know history are bound to repeat it.

China isn't a success story? so there rising tech industries and increased quality of living isn't success? them having a higher gdp than their colonizers isn't success?

You sound like a victim in an abusive relationship, ""yeah he gave me a black eye but he takes me out to dinner from time to time"", that's what you sound like. What is colonization? it's pillaging, destroying and enslaving. You're saying that was necessary for globalization, to centralize law and order. Japan wasn't colonized during that period so how come they established contact with the rest of the world? all they had to do was allow traders from europe to come in, that completely goes against what you just said. I mean, how does a foreign power whose goal is to exploit a country,help with globalization? The last Sinhala kingdoms were cut off from the rest of the world due to europeans occupying the coast so, how did globalization occur then when more than 500 years ago we had ships going up to china? Then you say it centralized law and order, what does that mean? there were massacres by the british that still took place, uva wellasa for example. There were people being enslaved in the congo and having there limbs cut off for not meeting rubber production quotas, does that sound like centralized law and order?

**""Reconciliation became a large part in their development.""**

Yeah, reconciliation after irreversible damage has taken place. It's like cutting off all your limbs and giving you a candy bar in the future. Only a Sri Lankan like you would be okay with that.

**""Native people of Australia today have more opportunities than they have ever had. Was their culture hurt, yea,""**

So becoming a minority in there own country, having there civilization and way of life completely destroyed, being actual second class citizens for decades upon decades is suddenly solved by having a few scholarships offered??? and that's forgetting how those people are [still](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/04/1135827) experiencing [racism](https://nit.com.au/30-05-2023/6157/racism-continues-to-plague-the-lives-of-aboriginal-people) and discrimination **in there own country**. You're out here saying ""oh that okay, cuz they have scholarship now DUH"", I mean if you're so confident in your beliefs I dare you to go up to actual australian natives and say it to there face, I want you to record it as well. If you think that we should go through the same harrowing experience that those people went through so we can be a minority in our own country and maybe get a few scholarships in the future to make up for it, you need to be thrown into the trash truck with the rest of the trash bags.

**""Fundemtally Lankans lack the global perspective. You need to see how the world works to see how archaic Lankan government and public facilities are. Colonisation may have been bad for us in the beginning. But colonies in the modern day have evolved into something greater than their founding principal of conquest and rule.""**

I studied in Canada and learned extensively about the natives in that land including talking to them in person, I just don't have my head up my rear-end enough to believe the same thing you believe. Your perspective is based on a FOB just looking at sky scrapers and the white people of those countries and going ""WOW"", it's surface level and very insincere in how you just toss aside what the natives of those lands lost and justify it with some scholarships or ""opportunities"" that're available now. 

It's people with your mindset, the mindset of having others do your hard work for you instead of doing your own hard work that made us become a colony in the first place. People who know about history know exactly what we lost from that and the consequences that are felt today by it.

Oh yeah, it was all thanks to the US, it's not like they were an empire with huge infrastructure for production in place or anything, all thanks to the US.

**""Withe the centralised law and order, from the colonial days you can find stock manifest of goods sold at markets on the street extending to upper legislative council. A full top to bottom line of accountability.""**

If that was the case, then people wouldn't be crying about crimes that were committed by colonizers to this day, they wouldn't be crying about the stolen treasures, the massacres or asking for reparations. You're trying very hard to show colonizers as saints who were only there to benefit the native people, lol.  Maybe they had centralized law and order in europe, it just didn't extend to the subjugated lands hence why there's so many crimes and bleak memories, which is non-existent according to you.

**""Not all colonial histories are the same, their are cases where local populations lived along side the British and came out better from it""**

So does that erase the ones where they did not come out better from it? let me ask you, why did these empires invade other lands? you're talking about how people benefitted from colonization, so is everyone talking about how detrimental colonialism was just crazy and you're the only right one?

**""Do I deny that what they went though was horrible, no. I would be stupid to say that. But a few scholships is the top of the islceburg when it comes to offerings from the government that are there to facilitate their way of life.""**

It's not the denying, it's the trivializing ""oh yeah, they just had to go through this and that but, you know now they have scholarships so, its okay"". Hilter believed that if he killed the jews, that the world would be a better place for the future. In essence, he believed that some people in the past suffering and dying is okay since it'll benefit the future generations. People who were colonized suffered and died, the bengal famine for example, now you are arguing in favor of colonialism. In essence you're saying that it's okay that those people from the past suffer, get killed and have everything stripped from them as long as the future generation benefits from the colonizer, that's very similar to the logic of mustache man. On top of that, the people you're talking about having ""opportunities"" are complaining about how they **still** have it bad, which apparently means nothing to you.

**""I have lived in Aus for over 15 years. So I have seen life here. Everytime I come back to Lanka for religious reasons, and to visit family, it's like a third world country. ""**

Maybe because you lived in Aus for 15 years you're detached from Sri Lanka, that's why you're suggesting this terrible thing to happen again. On top of that, I asked you a question before, what has the british done that makes them such a great option to go back to? people, especially Sinhalese Buddhists were heavily discriminated for school and jobs, only a few elite had access to schools that were mostly christian and you couldn't go in there without converting. Why would anyone want to go back to a time like that? does that sound beneficial to you?

**""Hope this gets it though to you that my concerns and beliefs are not a FOB ""WOW"". If anything if your account is right your experience is pretty FOB.""**

My experience is FOB? lol, you're the one here calling for british colonialism after living in australia. When I said you perspective is very surface level, I meant it. You see what's pretty and impressive in front of you without looking beyond what was taken from the original people who lived there. What happened to those natives in australia is most likely what would've happened to us and it's crazy that a Sri Lankan is advocating for us to be put in the same position, it's like a jewish person advocating for nazis. The opportunities and scholarships you're talking about, you do realize that could all be taken away with a change of the govt. right? even affirmative action is about to be abolished and your argument for colonialism is that we might get ""opportunities"" if we're colonized, lol.

**""I totally agree that one should act for oneself. The issue is Lanka hasn't and has proven that it can't.""**

How has it proven that we can't? the country has had bad politicians and that's proof that we should go back to subjugation from a foreign empire? does that make any sense to you?

**"" I believe that even beinga colonily maybe for even 5 to 10 years longer would have helped Lanka at least get off the grownd. ""**

Oh yeah, because the last 133 years they ruled was all rose and dandies right? they didn't have enough time to get the country off the ground in those 133 years. maybe they will in another 5 more years, lol.

**"" I might be young but every word you said lies on starving people, living some of the worst quality of life right now in the world, a failed system. ""**

This sub has to be the most progessive SL forum I've come across. 

With regard to the canada sub reddit, just because they fail to criticise  and self reflect, does not mean we shouldn't. The perahera was a political stint to appease Buddhist nationalists and disregarded covid regulations. It is extremely problematic when the government that allowed this to happen was more than happy to ban burial of muslims, claiming without any scientific evidence that it helped spread covid. There lies the problem. 

Further to this, the aftermath of the perahera was that 45 artistes contracted Covid. So, the criticism levied against the perahera was very valid. 

The question you should be asking is why doesn't r/canada  talk about their history and reconcile it and not use another country's failure to self reflect as an excuse to promote some bullshit narrative that there is anti-sinhalese or anti-buddhist hate.

3. UNHRC is a biased entity and they'll never prosecute the US for warcrimes, and that I admit. But this isn't about that. 
4. Let's take your ""Equality for all or no one gets it"" argument to its logical conclusion. Since, USA does not face prosecution, we should not stop or prosecute anyone what so ever for crimes against humanity/war crimes.

Ofc its not all men. My point is that we are turning a blind eye on Male violence. In other words, **its not all men, but too many men.**

Is it low or that it is not getting reported enough? and we cannot ignore the fact that sri lankans claim its abuse only when the woman is heavily injured or killed?

When most women go to the police, they would say go home forget about it etc. And abusive men will never change and their behaviour will only become more violent. AND its tooo late by then, she's gone.

I don't deny that women can be violent. But do women whine about it say that its generalizing women?

When a woman causes an accident, social media be like ALL WOMEN ARE BAD DRIVERS. Do we whine about that? But when we point that men are the perpetrators of the grave violence, men be like #NotAllMen. Why do men butt-hurt because of that?

>this rhetoric pursues exact opposite.

I dissagree, while you might not relate or perceive it as divisive history shows that a lot of changes start with a minority and great opposition. The opposition would then often reffer to said changes and how they where raised as divisive. You can read ""Violence of men towards woman"" as a generalisation of all men or you can read ""Violence of men towards woman"" as a plural wich indicates a problem given in  many society's and is definitely solvabel.

You seem like an intelligent gentleman so I wouldn't be surprised if you might come up with some ways to solve it? 

Maybe we should just hold each other accountable?

>Which do you prefer? Communities uniting against unacceptable, down right despicable behaviour? Or divided on the topic itself, without even looking at addressing the problem? Raising the problem is the easiest part, that doesn't even come close to solving it.

I have to say that raising the problem is one big step in solving it tho. I would even say trough controversy and division that more and more people become aware of the problem wich helps gathering people to solve the problem. Sri Lanka is a country that thrives on tourists, it is a big world with lots of people with too much time on their hands in need of a problem to solve so maybe controversy and opposition is exactly what this topic needs.

That's not to say that I do not prefer communities uniting, I however prefer a communitie where raising a problem about safety gets treated as a problem about safety and not gets treated as a personal vendetta for every guy who feels offended because they feel targetted by fiction because men is just plural and doesn't mean all men.

There is some truth in what you say about the amount of men persuading women into sex, thinking they're owed it. It's disgusting, I agree. 

I think a reason for this sort of thing is the lack of education about consent. Also a lot of people think that girls can't enjoy sex, and that they are sluts if they do. A lot of girls haven't discovered their own sexuality because of the repressive attitudes around this sort of thing. 

There are better ways to discuss this sort of thing than posting sad quotes and going on rants everywhere. 

How about starting a discussion on sexual assault, where people (both male and female) can share their own stories? Men do get sexually assaulted, even by women, even in Sri Lanka. Let's have some conversations about all the different forms of sexual assault and what we can do.

Or sex education, where we can talk about the strangest ideas we or other people have had before learning the reality? Or we could share stories of relationships conducted the Lankan way. Any of those would create more constructive discussion than what you've been doing. 

Finally, as an actual feminist, I want to tell people reading this - the feminist movement is not at all about the misandry we've been seeing in a lot of places, including here.

>There's nothing wrong with blowjobs, nudes or any of that

First off all I am not a liberal feminist and am a feminist who value the feminity of a woman. 

So I am against sex positive, sex work, anal sex, BDSM and all other things liberal feminists call as EMPOWERING.  

Do you know why I am against it? because giving a blowjob or nude is lowering yourself as a sex object for the pleasure of men. Feminity (not feminism) is about lowering yourself like that and girls are not their to please men. And as you know a woman can get more pleasure from a cunnilingus than a man from a blowjob. Nothing wrong with oral sex but it should be 50/50. but whats happening is that a girl doing everything and not getting the favor returned. In that case, hasn't the guy USED YOU FOR HIS PLEASURE?

I get pissed off when friends say they blow a guy and I always ask did you get the favor in return and they are like ""actually I didn't"". 

&#x200B;

> feminist movement is not at all about the misandry 

Open your eyes. Misandry is the result of misogyny. If men treated women with respect without harming, there won't be a feminism movement. Rape, domestic violence & MARTIAL RAPE (yes it is there, husband raping his wife), sexual harassment, gender discrimination these are all because of ""TOXIC PATRIACHY. I mean we can't even breastfeed a child in the public but these fashion companies run by men can show women with too much beauty standards in cheeky butt baring cleavage showing dresses in public, ads and banners. 

&#x200B;

> Also a lot of people think that girls can't enjoy sex, and that they are sluts if they do 

Yes, girls get judged for everything. Friendzoning stop us from saying NO. IF we enjoy sex they are a slut even though scientifically shown that women's orgasm is lot better fun than male orgasm.

&#x200B;

> I think a reason for this sort of thing is the lack of education about consent 

And also the media is always putting that feeling that men are suppoed to get sex, that sex is something they do to a woman and it increase their image. 

To the men reading, please don't be dumb enough to think that this conversation between me and her is a sign that women are more dangerous than men, that feminism is hurting women like that. Women and women argue but guy go too far where they even kill another guy to get his girlfriend or even groups kill a guy to rape a girl.",0,/r/srilanka/comments/ldz4qx/lot_of_guys_have_forgotten_this_in_school_there/gml7bk1/,1612797808.0

That is a problem even i'm having. When I asked she said to show her love, to do something exciting. but still I think its womens nature of being a little bit submissive than men. and boys also pressure the girl. if she say no at first he will pressure her and even threat saying he will leave her. and  the girl trust the guy thinking he will keep it private. I think again its that women are little bit scared of men. becuase who know that he will use his fist and dick if she say no. (i have heard where guy force the girl and record a sex tape by force without letting the girl to cover her face. so it is not the girl's fault)

THe girl also should know not to send, **but the guy also should know not to ask for nudes**. men should know that they should treat their women with respect and not as a sex object. 

Also i think its the social way of saying that women should give sexual satisfaction to men. so guys think sex is something a girl should give him and sex is something men do to women. One of my friend said a guy asked for a blowjob in the first day and when she said its too early he said ""i spent 4000 in the dinner and is this how are you repaying me"". like what the hell😡 the guy think she is like toy. in the past the only thing men thought was keeping the woman happy and not asking anything in return from the woman. now its like if you give flower, return favor with a blowjob.

and I don't care if a man respect a woman. i just dont care. I judge a guy by how he react when a woman is mad at him, if some guys makes a rape joke a real man will say stop it. if a guy is leaking nudes a real man will go and tell him face to face to stop it. that is how i judge a man.

Ohh boy! You literally are the definition of a toxic feminist.

>men should know that they should treat their women with respect and not as a sex object. 

Tell me why do you genaralize that men should act in a certain way and ""respect"" women? Who told you to think like that? This is your whole problem. If you expect half of the world, that's men to act according to your personal standards, this problem is not about men being assholes, this problem is about you being a naive little girl. How old are you?

 Nobody with half a brain expects a group of genaral population to act the same way just because they fit into that genaral population. You get what I'm saying. For example buddism is supposed to be the most peaceful laid-back and chill religion/philosophy in the world but we see that even among buddists there are extremists. Same with Islam and Christianity.

You and I both know that there are toxic, asshole pieces of shit in this world both men and ""women"". Regardless of their gender they are garbage human scum of the earth.

>One of my friend said a guy asked for a blowjob in the first day and when she said its too early he said ""i spent 4000 in the dinner and is this how are you repaying me""

What kind of friends are you hanging out with? I'm getting really suspicious of the situations you provide here. Are you only  hanging out with sexual violence victims? And neither of your friends has an ongoing healthy relationship with a man?

>in the past the only thing men thought was keeping the woman happy and not asking anything in return from the woman.

Really how old are you? From where did you accuire this perspective and mindset? You think women had it better 50, 60 or 100 years ago? Are you watching a shit ton of old romantic movies and impressed by how the man woes the woman?😂  Even then the man was trying his hardest to get under the woman's dress😂  just in a chivalric gentlemanly manor. The times were different but the goal was the same.

>men should know that they should treat their women with respect and not as a sex object. 

Again expecting ""all"" men in the world to act according to your personal standards.


>Also i think its the social way of saying that women should give sexual satisfaction to men. so guys think sex is something a girl should give him and sex is something men do to women

Like wtf? The first thing that came to my mind was what were they doing in a place that men;several, would literally masturbate Infront of them publicly? Were they raped? If so was a complaint made to the police or child/women issue authority?

>EVen I have being groped in bus. the latest one was a man keeping his hand near the bus stair so that he can intercept my breasts and just smiled. you dont know how sick it is when someone touch you without permission

If you experienced groping in a public place I'm sorry to hear that, and no I don't know what it feels to be touched without consent. what was your reaction?  Did you keep silence or did you shout at the top of your lungs at the harasser? See men who publicly grope women seek a thrill doing it and will enjoy it forevermore unless confronted face to face. Once the woman publicly shame him for what he did he'll think three times over before harassing another woman. Keep your mouth shut and he'll keep doing it until the day he dies. Speak up. Public gropers do what they do because they know the victim will keep their mouths shut and that's literally encouraging them to keep going. At the very least when you're being groped look directly into his eyes with a soul piercing stare to let him know that you know what he did and didn't like it.

>and I don't care if a man respect a woman. i just dont care. I judge a guy by how he react when a woman is mad at him

Women are told to be loving,caring,kind,submissive all the time. it is like that we should always be like that. but it is magic if a man is being caring,loving,kind. it should be the normal state. both men and women should be caring,loving and kind. it is not more for women and less for men.

i judge a man how he stand up for misogyny. if his friends make rape jokes,harass he should be man enough to say ""stop it"". is a girl is harassed in public, he should stand up for that girl. I don;t care if the guy is just being kind to a woman. he should prove it with actions.

That is the biggest No-No. Why do you need nudes to TO IMPROVE YOUR RELATIONSHIP?. Don't you have something called self-control? Is the emotional connection you have with the girl not enough? I think you are a buddhist, so don't you know what lord Buddha said about desire and craving? If you are an atheist you will say no because you guys think that cravings and desire is not a sin

Have you heard of objectification? by asking of nudes you are objectifying your GF because when you are looking at a nude you don't feel any LOVE and the only thing you feel is LUST THOUGHTS. Just ask it from yourself. when you are looking at your GF's nudes are you really feeling more love or aren't you seeing her as a sex object for your pleasure. It is not normal for a guy to ask for nudes and the guys who do have a weak mind and less self control",0,/r/srilanka/comments/ldz4qx/lot_of_guys_have_forgotten_this_in_school_there/gmf9xmw/,1612702627.0

That is true. some girls actually leave the innocent guys for some jerk. it happened to a guy I knew and he didn't ask for nudes or tried to take revenge. In fact he just started to have the best of his life and that woman said that the jerk is too demanding. 

But here is the thing. Guys don't show their true colors at first impression. they all act like angels (girls also btw). But you need to know that a guy can do more damage to a woman than a woman damaging a guy.

Well in the past that is how men impressed women. they showed respect and guys didn't have ego problems with that. but today if a guy opens a door to a girl then people say that he is unmanly, The media has made men degenrates that harassing is the new masculinity. 

And If you think that I am too demanding from men, just remember a woman goes through more labor when giving birth to a BOY. so don't you at least have some feeling of generosity?

Wow here comes the false accusations. believing the ""false accusation"" thing is also kind if a rape myth. Think 100 women get abused only 30 go and report. maybe 20 are fake so the only 10 are real. okay. but what about the other 70?

About the Amber heard and Depp case, Depp actaully beat heard 12 times before the incident ([https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13082970/johnny-depp-wife-beater-loses-libel-case-amber-heard-12-times/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13082970/johnny-depp-wife-beater-loses-libel-case-amber-heard-12-times/)). there is a 20 year age gap on them.  After that he said to the court that she is the one that beat him and made other fake accusation to her ([https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13083947/amber-heard-poo-johnny-depp-bed-dogs/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13083947/amber-heard-poo-johnny-depp-bed-dogs/)) 

&#x200B;

> I have friends from school who simp then just leave the girl for another just to say oh I dated her I date her and her 

That is because toxic masculinity say that guys like that are the real ""MEN"" and shame men who stay in a committed relationship saying things like a bitch slave or even say just try a side chick while in the relationship. Again OBJECTIFICATION. Your friends see girls like some sex objects to show off that they are men. 

&#x200B;

>Its the girl duty to judge and select who to date what can other guys do 

Why can't guys act like normal real people without being actors? And remember, when a girl say no most of the guys don't take it as a no. Some get pissed off and start to show their real colors or even start to insult the girl. OR some men think a no means a yes if you keep pressuring. so it is really hard for us.

Coz that is what happened here I dunno who started it but apparently both of them were very abusive to each other. 

I am not saying rape is false not at all what I mean is the reason ppl view it lightly is cause of women abusing it for various gains and thereby moving attention from the real issue...it’s very rare u find false rape in Asian countries tbh but what I was trying to say was cases like the Depp case is what ppl judge things on 

Plus what does Age have to do with anything they are both consenting adults if anything u can call amber a gold digger trying to be with a old guy(usually the reason to be with a old guy) however I don’t think it was the case here and they both liked each other prior.

Yes a corrupt AG won't let it through but with the public's backing and threat of force they would, NPP had a golden opportunity to work with the public to help this happen

Some Zionists rejected a Jewish state and simply wanted an Arab leader to listen. The only Arab leader that listneed was a guy called Fawzi Darwish al-Husayni who gave a speech on why pushing for a Arab state would end up in a civil war and Jews would fight for a Jewish state if they keep pushing. The dude was murdered as a traitor. 

After 1948 Jews who had allied with the Druze won a big and surprising victory. All Jews in the Arab side were expelled. Most Arabs in the Jewish side were also expelled but many Jews didn't like the idea. Druze also wanted to let their neighboruing Arabs stay and many Arab Bediuons fought for Israel because Jews helped them in many ways 

That is why 20% of Israel is Arab while there are no Jews in Palestine despite the Jewish Quarter being in the half Palestine got. Many Aramic speaking Christians who previously identified as Arabs revived their Aramean identity. 

Arabs decided to be part of Jordan and Egypt instead of forming a separate Arab State. 

Israel agreed.

Egypt however wanted Israel's lands. So they kept fighting and losing. The end came in the Six Day war. 

Israel wouldn't be taking Palestine if not for the Six day war. In fact after the war Israel actually achieved its goal of a Greater Israel. And Israel willingly gave up most of the land. 

So the entire thing could have been avoided by simply listening to the Jews. Should have listened to the original hasbara and the entire war and the partition could have been avoided. Arabic speaking Jews were writing entire papers in Arabic trying to explain Jewish affairs, that was what they called ""Hasbara"".",-3,/r/srilanka/comments/1gacb42/the_absolute_state_of_the_sub_right_now_and_the/ltdtisb/,1729708329.0

If they were, they wouldn't need the West to protect them.

u72msu,,comment,"To the OP, 
I am assuming you are part of the ethnic majority, I am too. Let me narrate a story. I am a Sinhala Buddhist that studied in a catholic convent. I was the minority there, so I learnt what it felt like to feel powerless. a small institution like a school can mimic a country and a democracy. I learnt there that when the idea of 2>1 directs to a conclusion that 2 is better, you tend to have in-group biases and concurrently display acts of micro aggression to groups that do not have strength in numbers. As cliche as it is, you have to put yourself in other people’s shoes. Before you say anything you have to listen and understand. Maybe this flag was previously associated with the concept of eelam but it can have a different meaning now. Do not jump to conclusions. The best thing you can do for this country, yourself and your community alike is ask, listen and understand the things you don’t know of. I do not mean any harm or offence to you, I think as the “majority” of this country it is our duty to shift the narrative and right our wrongs. We have suffered so much as a country, so please I beg you, listen. Thank you",3,/r/srilanka/comments/u72msu/for_those_who_wondered_and_defended_the_use_of/i5g7pj4/,1650435673.0

Kannadigas though have high subnationalism too, and the yellow and red colours are considered the traditional colours of the Karnataka flag.

u5smz9,,comment,"Can we stop talking about flags and start looking at the real problem which is that the war never really ended for some Sri Lankans when it did for us? 

Can we talk about the militarization in the north, silencing of the Tamil voices, the fact that Tamil mothers and fathers are still looking for their children, wives and husbands are still looking for their spouses? 

Can we talk about the war criminal (and criminal in general) who is our elected president now, who also allegedly ordered the death of hundreds of civilians and also dissolved the committee for missing persons and internationally claimed that all missing persons are considered expired?

The country is slowly coming together and as Sinhalese people we can’t expect citizens from the north to have gotten over the war which shaped a large portion of their lives, still do shape a large portion of their lives.

We have the privilege that they didn’t, which is to protest, express our anger, sadness and frustration. If we’re truly coming together now, we should share that privilege with them and amplify their voices as well. 

GotaGoGama is a shared platform and there are no clear set rules as to how one should protest as long as it does not offend religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation. For someone who’s been suppressed or denied of their rights for so long, can we blame them for the form of protest (in this case, a different flag) that they use? I’m not in the place to say if it’s right or wrong. I’m just saying it’s a true sentiment that is being displayed, and if we feel it can lead to some conflict, it is also our place to understand this sentiment and try to resolve it before it could start.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/u5smz9/saw_this_on_gotagogama_support_protest_at_jaffna/i56yd0f/,1650278133.0

I live in Colombo but recently went back to Jaffna after the whole economic crisis and I saw everyone barely complain or even speak about the economic crisis. Anytime it was brought up, they said that they had it worse during the civil war, they lacked necessities including electricity. Houses in Jaffna still have firewood stoves and still use kerosene lamps, and revert back to them whenever there is a power cut or gas shortage. While the rest of Sri Lanka was progressing the Tamils were stuck. It does feel bitter to see people hold up the flags of terrorists but this either is to derail the movement and cause ethnic hate or the actions of misinformed people. The reason why there aren’t a lot of protests in the North is because 1) we didn’t vote for Gota and Rajapaksas because we think he is a war criminal and is directly responsible for the death of thousands of tamils 2) Tamils really want a politician to who can represent them as equals and not be a second thought (some of them feel a change in government might help the majority of Lanka but bring no change to Tamils).

u5smz9,,comment,"It's disgusting to call all Tamils LTTE, all Muslims ISIS and all Sinhalese Ganasara followers.  


Answer to the bottom part of your comment is, just like other racist   
communities what LTTE doing is they mix up genuine Sri Lankan Tamils   
with them and that way they can get international sympathy. This is high  
 time that we should get together and fight as a one country instead of   
being segregated. Unfortunately some people weather it's Muslims,   
Sinhalese or Tamils trying to do is fight their rights separately. People  
 should stop  digging the past and stop spreading haterism.  


Weather it's North, East or South, people who only sentimental just for their races are disgusting racists. Politicians are better at spread racism and   
segregate people. Without that they cannot hold up powers. Instead of   
getting into that trap, what we should do is stand against them and   
build up great unity. Politicians are afraid when people being united.   
Not only politicians their henchmen and beneficiaries are afraid of the   
unity. While having luxury lives in other countries they just firing up   
countries like these.

And those sources too could be skewed because, judging by how much the gvt can influence the flow of information in this era of information, i can only imagine the control they had over an age where every media outlet was gvt owned, controlled and regulated. For example, Premakeerthi De Alwis murder, uo until recently, was credited to the insurrectionists (which everybody knew wasnt the case) but recently came it came to light that there was no reason for anybody, including his own fanily to think so.

What i meant was, directly or indirectly, every kill in the civil war is the hand UNP leader. Their action ls gave birth to and nurtured LTTE. Learn about black July, learn about how LTTE came to be. Learn about the weapons and dollars that flew across the frontline when a certain Indian politician was killed. And then tell me if you still think JVP is worse than, especially UNP (jvp within which massive shifts of ideologies, leadership have taken place since then, and the guy who allegedly sat there in shorts and watched as an entire generation of kids brutalized and burned at the helm of this country still)

Being sensitive to thousands of anecdotes, work of hundreds of contemporary literature and accounts of experiences about a very real thing that happened, and BEING SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT EVERY PIECE OF MEDIA AND GVT REPORT THAT CAME OUT OF THAT ERA, CAME OUT IN FAVOUR OF GVT, FROM GVT MEDIA, UNDER GVT SUPERVISION. is not blind slavery. However, saying ridiculous stuff like ""not a single innocent person was sent to Batalanda"" when its a very well known fact that army open fired in low caste villages (lived experiences of my low caste family and relatives), UNPhaving had a barely legal paramilitary called ""Blac Cats"" running, is not blind slavery. Acting like gvt then is this infalliable institution and they did everything for the betterment when the whole country whose head is not so far up UNPs ass is in agreement that history was much more complex and one of such nuance and intricacies and complexities, is total blind slavery. JVP commited crimes. So did the government (UNP)  and UNP government had control of the narrative, the stats, the media. Surely if you hate Mahindas so much , you mustve seen how much they could influence the media coverage of the things that happened during Galleface aragalaya, even in this golden age of information and that if it wasnt for the fact that there were phones and cameras, they'd have woven a very different narrative. But a gvt who had all the power, all the  control over media must have been nothing but good faith and everybody whose lived experience about it that says otherwise is a lie????? HUH? 

Lol you accused me of being Mahinda supporter. Lol im not, because i AM sensitive to the fact that figures, facts and numbers from  gvt presses and media are skewed and rarely to be devoid of political influence. Whereas when it comes to you, you are holding the same stance Rajapakshe bootlickers held and still hold: ""wHeRe's ypUr vErifiabLe ProOf"" because as far is i know, up until today, there's not a single verifiable piece of proof that Rajapakshes indeed did what they did. And if there was such, your supreme leader Ranil threw them under the rug to protect his friends. So your championing of sources and verifiable proof only applies for courses that you are biased for or against????

1fc4c1k,,comment,"I don't understand what you're trying to say here. You're accusing the JVP of committing crimes against humanity, but then implying they're somehow better than the government. What’s the real difference?  Governments do what’s necessary to maintain control. You never criticize how the government treated people in the north, in fact, you praise them for ending the war. There’s no humane way to practically deal with terrorists. Why would the government kill people who weren’t involved in terrorism? What benefit would they gain by killing civilians during 88/89? That's a wast of resources Maybe some people were wrongfully convicted, but that’s inevitable given the circumstances. Can you name a single war where civilians weren’t harmed? What’s important is that the government successfully ended the JVP terror group, which could have taken over Sri Lanka and established communist rule with the support of the Soviet Union. Imagine if the JVP had won things would have been much worse, and Sri Lanka could have ended up like North Korea.

What do you mean by saying the Sri Lankan army opened fire on low caste civilians? Where’s your proof? Are you suggesting all the soldiers were from high castes and would shoot their own people? That’s not how politics works. Your argument that the government did whatever it wanted because there were no phone cameras back then is childish. In the 80s and 90s, international watchdog groups were monitoring the internal wars in Sri Lanka, including JVP terrorism and the war in the north yet you can't find a single international record supporting your claims. And when I provided sources for my information, you dismiss them, saying it’s not there. If you're so eager to know, go look it up yourself it’s all available.

 If you hold yourself to the same standards, then you dont have any proof to call out Rajapakshas as well. The fact that you cannot even accept the possibility of the gvt being corrupt, based on thsouands of accounts from ppl all over the country at the time is insane.

Now, don't jump to conclusions and claim that the Sri Lankan government threatened the delegation to alter the numbers this is as accurate as it gets. On top of these figures, the JVP is responsible for indoctrinating thousands into becoming terrorists, leading to their deaths.  

Yes, the government banned the JVP, but that was after their first armed insurrection in 1971. The party was banned to protect democracy, which was the right move, wasn't it? Many of its leaders were imprisoned or went underground during this time. Imagine if JVP was successful sri lanka would be a extremists communist country like North Korea 

As for the Rajapaksa corruption allegations, Anura claims to have all the evidence hidden in a file. So how can the Supreme Court arrest the Rajapaksa family without it? Now, don't tell me the Supreme Court is corrupt Anura hasn't revealed the evidence, and I already have the best answer for that. Don’t embarrass yourself.

Now dont give that ""eVEyBODy gVT kiLLeD tOo was JVPs fAult thAts wHY i SAiD thAt JVP kiLLed 60k"" because for all your reliable sources trusting you have not been giving me straight asnwers either.

So many buzzwords in your arguement man ""like north korea,"" ""protect democracy"" you probably actually think that Wijeweera was a CIA spy. and your ""protect democracy"" point probably comes from that Petrol Bomb hurling incident where it was ruled by the courts that it wasnt a member of JVP (find and read the dictum if you want to, im playing your game now) it wasnt some grand crusade to protect democracy. What it was a culling of a new political power, using the control of narratives under the guise of democracy. And ppl like you gobbled that shit right up.

My contention is not that JVP commited crimes. My contention is that you are willing to take everything that came out from the then gvt as truth and nothing but the truth. If that doesnt make you a blind slave when as ive been saying 100s of separate and individual accounts of what happened collaborate to a different narrative of how things went down but you decide your version of history i guess.

I CANT BELIEVE IM ABOUT TO TALK IN FAVOUR OF RAJAPAKSHES but if you are so hung up on ""actual reliable sources"" what actual source do you have to dislike Rajapakshes or claim their misdeeds? Nothing, not even a case filed in a court. But you know it happened because we both lived through it even if ITN and Diwayina kept on hammering on and on otherwise. Oh but when it comes to JVP, UNP and SLFA, everything that came out from that time must be right and reliable right? Eventhough the gvt positively prevented ANY other independent news source from coming up with their own reports or collaborating the gvt ""sources.""

And no, JVP didnt just throw a wrench in our booming econony.  Rise of JVP happened because the gvt was fucking up. This stuff is well documented history my guy. You clearly dont know your history either. Youve just read and heard just to the point where it fortifies your biases and havnt carefully ventured out a single outside the comfort of your biases and prejudices.

1fc4c1k,,comment,"Now you're changing what you said. You now admit that 60,000 people were killed during the JVP conflicts, but you still haven’t answered my question, what exactly was the JVP fighting for? Was our economy already struggling before JVP terrorism? The statistics suggest otherwise. Were there gas lines, petrol shortages, or power cuts? Was our economy suffering at that time? You're unclear about what the JVP was supposedly standing up for.
If you're referring to the Indian Peacekeeping Force in defense of the north, it's clear you don't understand the history. Do you even know the outcome after the Indian Peacekeeping Force took control? That was part of President J.R. Jayewardene’s strategic brilliance. Before telling me to study history, perhaps you should learn it first. 
It's also funny that you support the Supreme Court ruling that the petrol bombing was not committed by the JVP, but when the same court declared Rohana Wijeweera a terrorist responsible for thousands of deaths, you claim the court is corrupt. And all the legal records are fake Isn't that hypocrisy? There was clear evidence that Wijeweera was a terrorist. While the government may be bad, the JVP was far worse.As I mentioned before, 60,000 people lost their lives because of the conflict initiated by the JVP. Had the JVP not started the conflict, all those 60,000 people would still be alive today.

Regarding your comment on the Rajapaksa family, you claim there is no evidence to arrest them. Yet your own leader, our honourable Anura Kumara Dissanayake, claims to have all the evidence hidden in a file, which he hesitates to release. I'm not the one saying this it's your own leader, AKD. Have you ever questioned why? Who needs ITN or any other media channel when Anura supposedly has all the evidence? If he truly has the evidence, he could easily bring down the government without even waiting for an election. Why isn’t he releasing it? Is he lying, or is he hiding it to cover his own misdeeds?

"" farmers overuse chemical fertilizers. This coupled with some other factors has caused soil health/structure degradation. Therefore, it'll take several years before the soil health can be restored to an extent where additional nutrition (via chemical fertilizers) won't be necessary for yield security. "" grated he is not talking specifically about tea plantations but I believe vegetable and paddy crops. ""

Additionally [this](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/249335396.pdf) is a published study on using organic fertilizer specifically for tea plantations, and ill quote its conclusion :

"" It is concluded from the study that organic fertilizer in the form of Hyosung performed the best and lowered the soil pH which is required for the growth of tea. Plant height, number of leaves and number of branches, organic matter were enhanced due to application of maximum dose of organic fertilizer. Since the chemical fertilizers deteriorate the physical properties of soil and organic fertilizer improve physical properties and fertility status of the soil, improves water holding capacity and structure of the sandy soil, the chemical fertilizer may be replaced with organic fertilizer.Experiments should be continued to evaluate the beneficial effect of organic fertilizer on the growth of tea and fertility status of the soil to have an eco-friendly plantation and conservation of ecology and natural habitat without polluting soil, air and water and yet maintaining sustainable tea production.

uscy1r,,comment,"For those who are unaware of what happened here is a quick synopsis.

Sri Lanka has about 70% of its population who are Sinhalese, about 12% Tamils, and rest who are Muslims and Burgers (Euro Asians).

Starting from the 70's, the LTTE which was a Tamil faction in Sri Lanka wanted a separate state. Backed by politicos, there was a riot in 1983 that led t o many Tamil's being killed for political or personal gain. The LTTE took advantage of this situation to strengthen their reasoning for a separate state.  They however used children to fight the cause on the battle field as they were easy to turn and they invented the suicide vest which is now used by many terrorist organizations today.

They resorted to killing many people Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims by bombing busses, trains, schools, etc and even raiding Tamil villages to kidnap and turn the children in the villages as LTTE carders. This, together with the fact that they used children, branded them terrorists internationally. Towards the end of the war in 2009, they took refuge within the fleeing general public among the Tamil villages which paved way to an unfortunate loss in civilian lives mostly Tamils as they used them as human shields. The LTTE and its supporters of today, continue to use the loss of lives in these villages as a justification towards the war.",2,/r/srilanka/comments/uscy1r/tamil_genocide_09_slide_credits_47roots/i95e4de/,1652924003.0

uscy1r,,comment,"You raise a good point. These posts suggest only part of the story, albeit an important part to the whole complex social situation that has been simmering since the British up and left. This is a very important part to understand how our innocent brothers and sisters up north/east suffered. But I imagine there are many stories of sons/daughters waiting for their mothers/fathers and vice versa who never came home all over the country who are scarred by the very memories of the war and they will suffer through that for the rest of their lives. So it's almost trivial to paint this side of the story without taking a moment to realise and recognise, that this goes beyond just being Tamil or Sinhalese. It impacted every Sri Lankan in one way, shape or form.

Frankly, I have been posting this quite a bit on this subreddit, but really it comes down to each other listening to different point of views, without trying to brandish justice or try and one up the other side with ""oh but look how much our side suffered"". Truth is, the whole country was gripped by war and countless innocent lives were lost. The complications of race politics and mass discrimination should be thought of in the past tense as we come to grips with the fact that the people in Sri Lanka need to band together to create a better future. No matter what the country was like pre-colonisation, post-colonisation left Sri Lanka and many other nations in South Asia with this quandary of trying to fill the gap the British left. One to rule them all mentality. It's a false/antiquated method of thinking in a world where diversity is the strength to move forward. We must question our own beliefs to supplement this economic journey back to normalcy.

uscy1r,,comment,"Despite grave danger in the conflict zone, the LTTE refused civilians permission to leave, 
using them as hostages, at times even using their presence as a strategic human buffer between 
themselves and the advancing Sri Lanka Army. It implemented a policy of forced recruitment 
throughout the war, but in the final stages greatly intensified its recruitment of people of all ages, 
including children as young as fourteen. The LTTE forced civilians to dig trenches and other 
emplacements for its own defences, thereby contributing to blurring the distinction between 
combatants and civilians and exposing civilians to additional harm. All of this was done in a 
quest to pursue a war that was clearly lost; many civilians were sacrificed on the altar of the 
LTTE cause and its efforts to preserve its senior leadership. 
From February 2009 onwards, the LTTE started point-blank shooting of civilians who 
attempted to escape the conflict zone, significantly adding to the death toll in the final stages of 
the war. It also fired artillery in proximity to large groups of internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
and fired from, or stored military equipment near, IDPs or civilian installations such as hospitals. 
Throughout the final stages of the war, the LTTE continued its policy of suicide attacks outside 
the conflict zone. Even though its ability to perpetrate such attacks was diminished compared to 
previous phases of the conflict, it perpetrated a number of attacks against civilians outside the 
conflict zone

I have been very clear on the usage of terrorism from LTTE. Talking about LTTE in positive light in the sub and the pro-Sri Lankan sub (which should be called pro-Sinhalese nationalism) gets you rapidly downvoted. This shows where the dynamics of the conversation is at - there is no both sides. 

Whenever I talk about the Sri Lankan army negatively I get downvoted or people refer to the LTTE with my intentions (which I have never said my actual personal stance on the organisation).

Just maybe? I’m trying to actually build unity that was nonexistent from I would say 1970 onwards. 

It’s always one side taking up the room and trying to justify the war crimes and genocidal acts from the state. Why do you think pro-Sinhalese associate Tamils with LTTE?

tny028,,comment,"Given the 'serious reps only' tag I'm taking it as an intellectual discussion. 

In short, I don't think it'll make much difference. As one of the redditors had already responded, India is a union of states. Each state has a government and is responsible for powers and duties allocated to them. We will still have the kind of fools that we suffer today in politics and public service. The benefit will be at the world stage with foreign policy and trade which I don't see as much of a benefit.

We will probably have access to a bigger market for our goods but will be overwhelmed by competition, so my read is that we lose more than we gain. Our talent will have more options to are likely to move to  places like Bangaluru than their talent move to us. 

If we ask to merge today I see two major problems. 
First is the people, they don't want us and we don't want them.  We have a cultural predisposition to dislike each other a fair bit (as the some of the comments here will show)
Second, India and China don't get along well which means both parties have a good reason to block this move.

1. India has to take responsibility for all the debt Sri Lanka has accrued over the decades, plus there's no significant economy in Sri Lanka to speak of except the tourism industry. It might be beneficial for Sri Lankan citizens who might move to cities like Bangalore and Gurgaon for IT jobs but what does Sri Lanka bring to the table from the perspective of India?

2. From the pov of a Sri Lankan, they are used to seeing Sri Lanka as a sovereign country and relegating it to the status of an Indian state would feel like a downgrade, even if many of the Indian states have much bigger economies. It's a bit like asking Cuba to join the US (although the difference between India and Sri Lanka isn't as drastic as it's between the US and Cuba), even if California or other states in the US have bigger economies than Cuba, Cuba would still choose to remain as a sovereign country because of nationalism that has been developed over the years.",8,/r/srilanka/comments/tny028/why_cant_or_shouldnt_sri_lanka_merge_with_india/i2659eu/,1648282102.0

Most of the benefits of unification could be achieved by a treaty for free trade (movement of goods) and open borders (movement of people) and maybe a defensive alliance.

It is enough to remain amicable and uphold the ancient ties between our people.

But this is only small advantage
Sri Lanka had much better development indicators very much comparable if not better than Kerala considered to be progressive state in India but their economy and growth opportunities are disaster

If I read other posts, Sri Lanka even declined to build a road bridge to connect to India. So joining India is far fetched from people's perspective

Any small country citizens can feel intimidated by bigger country neighbor and politicians use that to  build narratives

tny028,,comment,"To all those who question, what is to be gained by India from this merger, the same question can be posed to most of the Indian states. What is gained by India when Manipur joins the union, or more drastic, Bihar! A multi cultural India has no foundation core and remaining peripherals. Every region is a core in its own unique terms. And SL would be another unique core of a multi cultural India. 

India gains quite a bit: Most importantly, Maritime supremacy in IOR, which gives Complete control over the only route employed by Oil tankers going to China. And more importantly no threat of construction of any Chinese ports or submarine stations to counter Indian supremacy. To those who think these can be achieved via treaty, imagine how difficult it would be to keep SL politicians hooked when there is a far richer and stronger China giving them incentives (/bribes) on the other side. And China also understands it very well, that if there is any chink in their armor against India, it is their oil supply route from Middle East via Indian Ocean. That’s why the urgency to complete CPEC (which India has pretty efficiently tackled as things are unraveling now in Balochistan). 

What SL gains: A far more economically stable country. A much decreased dependence on imports of basics like food, electricity etc. A terrific education system (I’m sure there nothing comparable to an IIT Kanpur or IIT Bombay in SL). A burgeoning IT industry and jobs. 

The folly some of you do, is to imagine Country Boundaries as a given/ axiomatic/ sacrosanct. Borders move and change. It’s difficult to imagine if ever Manipur was in same boundary as Gujarat (maybe it was for a few years under some massive empire, but not for any meaningful part of history). Anyhow the current set of states in the Union is pretty random - a fascinating turn of events that has led to this collection coming together. 

For majority of last recent history before British (say Mughals to pre British), Hindustan was majorly north India + current Pakistan + Bangladesh. South India was pretty much always a separate set of kingdoms, pre British. 

So do not believe that current set of states in the Indian union make sense and 1 new state won’t. All of these make sense, and merging SL into India makes the utmost sense now.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/tny028/why_cant_or_shouldnt_sri_lanka_merge_with_india/i8bm4eq/,1652365825.0

This is the bottom line, Tamils had grievances in Sri Lanka, most of came about due to British preference of Tamils over Sinhalese, typical colonial divide and conquer. 

Sri Lanka got into ethnic problems when it tried to undo these precolonial preferences and went overboard supporting a Sinhalese point of view along with anti -Tamil pogroms. 

Yes this lead to a bunch of Tamil youths taking up arms, it would have not gone anywhere without India intervening with arms and training. They clearly supported terrorism, attack against civilians, massacre of Buddhist bhikkus all directed by Indian handlers that only LTTE and TELO followed, other groups like PLOTE, EPRLF and EROS didn’t. 

Then when LTTE took the quest for Tamil Eelam seriously and didn’t follow Indian direction, Tambrahm lobby connected the innate antipathy the Indian establishment has over Indian Tamil nationalism (they wanted independence in 1950s) and connected it to Eelam Tamil nationalism and worked in the background to change Indian policy w.r.t Sri Lanka starting from Rajiv Gandhi’s time. They N Ram of the Hindu, Cho Ramaswamy of Tuglak, Jeyalalitha of ADMK to Subramaniam Swamy of BJP to name a few compelled India to not only participate in the mass murder of Eelam Tamils and then people like Nambiar a Malayalee in the UN covered this mass murder of POWs and internment of civilians in concentration camps. 

In summary without the active participation of India in Sri Lanka’s internal politics and the active lobbying of Tambrahms to annihilate Eelam Tamils as a viable ethnic group with long term strategic threat to India (if Tamil Eelam becomes a reality then Tamil Nadu will become independent was their simplistic argument) , Eelam Tamils will not find themselves in the status they are in now. If the Sin-Bud fired the guns, it’s India and Tambrahms who gave the gun and directed it towards Eelam Tamils. 

For a self proclaimed Tamil, your reading of your own history is inadequate, analysis is colored by a racist mindset and evaluations are completely faulty. Don’t blame me or my supposed religion for that. If you found out who I really am, you will circumcise yourself and become a Muslim in shame.

I just assumed you were either a Sinhalese nationalist or a muslim because of your predilection with pinning all the blame on India and excusing the toxic Sinhalese Buddhist majoritarianism that played a role in the genocide. You went from racist to Islamophobe to branding me a Nazi for that simple statement lmfaoo. 

>This is the bottom line, Tamils had grievances in Sri Lanka, most of came about due to British preference of Tamils over Sinhalese, typical colonial divide and conquer. 

>Sri Lanka got into ethnic problems when it tried to undo these precolonial preferences and went overboard supporting a Sinhalese point of view along with anti -Tamil pogroms. 

First you start off by blaming the British for their supposed divide and rule policy, which is funny because it's so typical of south asians to blame the Brits to excuse their racial and religious bigotry. Indians and Pakistanis do it all the time and say that the reason for India and Pakistan's enmity is due to Britain's divide and rule policy, which is bull crap because the fundamental basis of their enmity is rooted in the Hindu-Muslim bigotry that has existed since time immemorial in the subcontinent. And the reason for the Sinhalese-Tamil conflict is because the Sinhalese have always viewed Tamils as ""outsiders"" to the Buddhist nature of their island and Tamil kings are viewed as ""invaders"" who wanted to erase their own Buddhist history, which is not too unfamiliar for me given how Islamic history and past muslim kings are viewed by the majority of Hindus in India. 

And this feeling of resentment towards Tamils was only heightened when more Tamils were in the administration. This wasn't because the Brits had a special affinity towards Tamils but simply because a section of Tamils took to English education more because the British had established missionary schools in Tamil dominated areas. Immediately after independence, Sri Lanka went the right wing path when its Oxford educated politicians resorted to far right policies in order to appease their Sinhalese majority and to curtain the growth of the leftist parties. This happened via 

1. The Ceylon citizenship act which immediately made a significant majority of the hill country Indian Tamils stateless who made some 12% of Sri Lanka's population.

2. This was followed by the Sinhala only act to remove Sri Lankan Tamils who had relatively dominated the administration and public service before. Sri Lankan Tamils went from forming 30% of the public administration and nearly 60% of doctors and engineers to less than 5% in public service. A lot of public servants were forced to retire because they didn't know Sinhala.

3. Then the policy of Standardization was adopted to curtail the enrolment of Tamil students in universities by creating a cap on their enrolment.

4. And then you had the state sponsored resettlement of Sinhalese speaking farmers in the predominantly Tamil speaking northern and eastern provinces to bring about a demographic change (reminscent of Israel's policy in Palestine). 

5. And then you had the numerous state sponsored pogroms and riots against Tamils starting from the Gal oya riots in 1956, widescale anti Tamil riots in '58, anti Tamil pogrom in '77, burning of the Jaffna library in '81 constituting a cultural genocide, anti tamil pogrom in '81, culminating in the biggest, the most vile and the bloodiest of them all in the Black July anti Tamil pogroms. As a result of these consistent anti Tamil riots and pogroms, the Tamils had to face thousands of killings, rapes and murders of their women and children and destruction of their properties. 

It was only at this point the demand for a separate state started somewhere in 1973. The Tamil parties previously thought the partition of Sri Lanka would be suicidal and always campaigned for a unitary country but they were forced to take a separatist stand when the majority was just blood thirsty and simply didn't see their Tamil minority as equal human beings. Why would they choose to live in a country where the majority was brainwashed on Sinhalese Buddhist ultra nationalism and were hell bent on destroying the presence of minorities in the island. Touch wood the communal harmony in Tamil Nadu has always been maintained and we have rarely seen anti minority riots and communal pogroms in Tamil Nadu as we have seen in Sri Lanka. But imagine if the Sinhalese people existed as a minority in Tamil Nadu and Tamil mobs kept killing the Sinhalese people and raping Sinhalese women, the Sinhalese would inevitably be forced to pick up arms to protect themselves and rightfully so, which is what the Tamils did. If the Sinhalese majority hadn't been racist to their minority, they wouldn't have picked up the guns at all. 

Yes, the Indian state had an infamous role in the conflict, when the IPKF forces indulged in human rights violations against the Tamil people in Sri Lanka and the Indian state helped the Sri Lankan state in the final stages of the war when the most war crimes took place. So yes, India ""helped"" Sri Lanka in a way to extinguish Tamil militancy forever in the island nation. But it didn't ""instigate"" or ""create"" this conflict, it had everything to do with the racist behaviour of the Sri Lankan state towards its own citizens. To say otherwise is just being an apologist for the genocidal Sinhalese majoritarianism, which is what most Sri Lankans have been brainwashed to believe. Sure, I'm not saying none of the non-Tamils have an understanding of the conflict. But I can't take someone seriously when he has a biased Sinhalese nationalist version of the events. It's a bit like reading about the conflict in Palestine from the Israeli version of events, instead of asking a Palestinian pov.

tny028,,comment,"Bull crap. India supported Tamil insurgency initially because Sri Lanka went into the ambit of the US-Pakistan nexus and wanted to use the Tamil issue as a leverage. Later India realised that an independent eelam would serve no purpose to India except to worsen relations with Sri Lanka and perhaps instigating subnationalism and separatism in Tamil Nadu. So it ended up allying with Sri Lanka in crushing that insurgency. India looked for its own geopolitical reasons, which is fair enough. But here comes a Bihari who says India started the insurgency because of a few politicians in Tamil Nadu lmao.

Public reaction towards road incidents seems to vary on certain socio-economic markers of the accused driver: type of vehicle the accused drives, the language he/she uses, ethnicity (obviously) and more importantly gender.

If the accused “looks” affluent the reaction is scathing, almost always operating on the assumption that some form of bribery is going to take place in future (in some cases it actually does, so not completely unfounded). If it’s a woman all sorts of misogyny comes hurling down, mostly by single and senile older male individuals who are clearly driven by sexual jealousy. I’m not even going to outline what happens when the accused is a minority.

On the other hand, if people feel the accused belongs to their social strata they tend to be more sympathetic to his/her plight.

Any child would've gotten this treatment from police, even in a court the sentence that he would get is different from what an adult would get. That's not because he's rich but because he's a minor.

The rich being able to get away is not only a Sri Lankan problem. Happens everywhere. However that does not mean you or I are allowed to go full vigilante and beat the shit out of someone.

So then what's stopping an angry crowd beating up an LGBT person? Or a minority? Because mob mentality kicks in, and they think whatever the crowd of 50 people in the mob thinks, is right. They will not stop until the man is dead.

What gives a group on the road to decide the fate of a man, regardless of his crime?

I drive on the same road that this accident happened, least 4-5 times a week. Last week, I saw a Wagon-R kill a bike rider, and the fault was the Wagon-R's driver.

Yet, when the cops came, they did not beat him up. They took him into custody, and got his statement. 

Stop making blanket statements like ""if he was poor, this would have happened"".

qnxr5u,,comment,"Or is it just that it reveals the nativity in your attempt of cherry picking an example and trying to generalize it to a whole group, the police. I never pointed at this video to make the case that police forces were good or bad, you on the other hand provided one example to prove your accusation against the police as a whole. Thariq's case is an exception, not the general rule. Existence of an exception of the general truth doesn't disprove the general truth. The fact that there are thousands of cases where police officers go above and beyond thier call of duty to serve and protect, whether it's in the middle of a pandemic or a natural disaster or any other situation and you have to cherry pick to find examples of the police engaging in unfair practices just proves that it depends on the individual police officers. But of course according to you one example of brutality nullifies all the great things done by the police. There's corrupt bunch,yes, but to point at that to suggest that the police as a whole is corrupt is peak intellectual dishonesty and is what leads to stuff like ""defund the police"" movement, but for all I know, that's a desirable outcome from your POV.",0,/r/srilanka/comments/qnxr5u/if_you_are_rich_in_sri_lanka_even_if_you_kill/hjl2spt/,1636226296.0

s2pulk,,comment,"**NOTE:**

>As the flag was originally posted for the first time in [my DeviantArt last October 2018](https://www.deviantart.com/ramones1986/art/Flag-of-alternate-Sri-Lanka-770488554?ga_submit_new=10%3A1642044730&ga_type=edit&ga_changes=1), there are more notable differences (and in effect, discrepancies) in relation to the PoD behind it: While at the time, I wrote about an Austronesian-speaking Sri Lanka (more specifically, Barito-speaking, the same family as as Malagasy), this time I'm now posting this as the flag of an Austroasiatic-speaking Sri Lanka (most specifically, the southern Munda languages), as I realized about the genetic history of the Sinhalese and their relations with Banglas and Oriyas.

**DESCRIPTION AND CONTEXT:**

>This is basically a combination of [OTL Sri Lankan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg)/[Kandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:King_of_Kandy.svg) and [Sarnaist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sarnaism_flag.svg) flags (In 2018, [Malagasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg)/[Merina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Merina_people.svg) flag): The maroon from the former, red and white from the latter, although there is discrepancy in relation to the shade of red as depicted in the flag because I made it back in 2018, and there's a possibility that I could re-color it. The depiction of the lion is the same as the Sri Lankan/Kandy flag, but the *Bo* leaves are more widespread.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/s2pulk/alternate_history_flag_of_austroasiaticspeaking/hsfzuor/,1642046293.0

1foyb3q,,comment,"I appreciate your answer.

I understand the concern about potential differences in educational content between provinces, but that’s precisely where federalism can strike a balance. Just because provinces have control over education doesn’t mean the national framework or core curriculum needs to be abandoned. The central government can still mandate national educational standards to ensure consistency in essential subjects like history, science, and civics, while allowing provinces the flexibility to tailor certain aspects to their regional needs. This approach can actually enrich the educational system by reflecting local cultures, languages, and histories, while maintaining unity in foundational areas. Decentralisation in areas like teacher training, examination management, and textbook distribution could also lead to more efficient, locally-responsive educational administration that better serves specific community needs.

As for policing, federalism doesn’t mean completely separate police forces for each province. Many federal systems balance both national and local policing bodies that work together. Local control over policing ensures that law enforcement is more responsive to the community it serves, while national oversight ensures consistency on broader issues like national security. A decentralised police force, accountable to local communities, can reduce corruption and inefficiencies. 

In Sri Lanka, for example, particularly in the Northern Province, there are many instances where Sinhala-speaking police officers are appointed to regions where Tamil is predominantly spoken. This creates significant barriers to justice, as clear communication between the police and the local population is essential. Localising the police force would allow officers to speak the local language and understand the community’s needs better, ensuring both sides are able to communicate effectively. Expecting millions of people to learn another language just for the convenience of a centralised authority is a major inconvenience for those communities, and decentralisation can resolve that imbalance.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1foyb3q/map_of_socialist_ceylon_alternate_history/lp0tjx7/,1727359888.0

For us economists, USAID is a fascinating case study in game theory and the Samaritan’s Dilemma: we fund knowing some of it will be mismanaged, yet we continue because the alternative is worse.

The corruption isn’t in politicians; it’s largely in private contractors who shuffle funds around until they vanish. Back in 2018, I had lunch with James Bullard, former president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve. While we didn’t discuss USAID directly, he mentioned that 20-35% of foreign aid typically never reaches its intended beneficiaries. This loss is significant, but it’s expected.

Why do we tolerate it? Because the greater good outweighs the inefficiencies. Foreign aid, even when mismanaged, promotes global stability and security, preventing larger crises that could ripple back to us. It’s a calculated trade-off: imperfect aid is still better than none.

that ain't how it works.... farmers dont magically get livelihoods, they need fertilizer, equipment, weather forecasting, education on optimal farming strategies and a whole load of other things especially in a place like Sri Lanka with a lot of subsistence farmers where a lot of people can barely make enough to survive.

Another example is the several ambulances that USAID has purchased along with hospital beds and medical equipment, and also the scholarships to universities given to Sri Lankans

This comment alone shows how ignorant you are and how detached you are from reality.

Just having the title 'farmer' or having a land to cultivate does not magically make the crops appear for a profitable harvest.

Long before USAID Sri Lanka actually had diversity programs i.e. The Z score system in local universities is to allow folks from diverse regions and income segments gain acccess to free education.",7,/r/srilanka/comments/1ijxid2/starving_children_can_wait_we_gotta_spend/mbkqvkp/,1738974380.0

You should try a simple Google search before spewing utter bullshit.

Your conspiracy theories can be laid to rest by lodging a RTI request to get detailed  proposals and outcomes of USAID projects that were executed partnering with a govt agency:

1ijxid2,,comment,"What you call massive sums are miniscule sums to their budget. Total USAID spending was 43.8 billion in 2023, compared to about 200 million over about an 8 year period in Sri Lanka. With about 25 mil USD and year, that's about 0.05% of the total spending. Basically nothing.

As for details, they're all listed on their websites(before it was shut down anyway), but here's some alternatives;

1ijxid2,,comment,"But our government also spends huge amounts in fertilizer subsidies, equipment, etc. There are also UN programs and a bunch of NGOs that do farming ""education"" (also controversially btw). 

Things like ambulance donations are pretty standard (I've seen Japan do most). There are loads of private and foreign governments that donate medical stuff and whatnot yet many hospitals still lack facilities. In SL, I think UN and EU programs and NGOs offer the most ""aid"" compared to US so I doubt this shutdown affects us in a negative manner. 

What everyone should be concerned about though is what's going to replace USAID (as it's not disappearing entirely). The new conservative US government could easily start replacing these kinda liberal programs with insane right wing programs (like anti-vax propaganda). So I think it's best USAID is shuttered now before they implement new programs that could do serious damage.",-6,/r/srilanka/comments/1ijxid2/starving_children_can_wait_we_gotta_spend/mbirrp3/,1738953103.0
1ijxid2,,comment,"That program you list is for TOURISM not farming. That fact that farming is hard is SL is a well known fact, and there are tons of local and foreign programs supposedly aimed at ""improving"" farming (by getting local farmers hooked on GMO seeds and fossil fuel fertilizer at the expense of sustainable farming methods that have lasted centuries. In fact, these GMOs seeds is one reason we can't easily switch to organic farming). The Agri department also runs a bunch of these programs, not necessarily funded by foreign governments with shady intentions. The US has been the primary driver of the ""green revolution"" in South Asia that has not always been in the best interest of local agriculture. These programs have been active for years. Has farming improved? Has soil erosion? No they haven't; go get *yourself* a reality check man.

PS: ofc USAID projects have execution details, it's the LAW to have those. doesn't necessarily mean the programs are executed in the manner as stated.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1ijxid2/starving_children_can_wait_we_gotta_spend/mbixh5j/,1738954714.0
1ijxid2,,comment,"You keep linking that tourism report everywhere, which is just a proposal and does not list outcome or a breakdown of costs. Also, it lists multiple donors, including UNDP. 

You also don't have answers just accusations against people who have critical questions about these USAID programs that use these fuzzy terms commonly thrown about by the INGO crowd. There's no explanation or reasoning as to why these programs would cost as much despite not doing much. 

PS: RTI requests don't work that way. Who the hell has ever gotten details of a foreign aid program via an RTI request?",-9,/r/srilanka/comments/1ijxid2/starving_children_can_wait_we_gotta_spend/mbj7k3z/,1738957610.0
1ijxid2,,comment,"Ofc it's minuscule for the Americans, and also when compared to the massive global scale of USAID. That is not the point. 

The point is, why do they need to spend that much money in SL, when salaries and other costs are covered in rupees, and generally do not cost much at all? What results do they even get after spending billions of rupees on a journalist ""education"" program? We already have gender neutral terms in local languages, and also pronouns is hardly the most pressing concern for local journalism. 

Again, language like in the job posting you linked (""...\[addressing\] good governance, women’s empowerment and gender equality, inclusive economic growth, environment and climate action, and regional and international relations. We work with innovative leaders and communities to build effective institutions and advance path-breaking reforms..."") is just standard neolib nonsense that's not very specific.",1,/r/srilanka/comments/1ijxid2/starving_children_can_wait_we_gotta_spend/mbj1lzx/,1738955901.0
