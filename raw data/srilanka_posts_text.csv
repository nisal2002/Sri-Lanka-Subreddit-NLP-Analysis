1osnjtw,Here we go. People opposing the implementation of Sex Education. How can we ever improve as a country with this mindset? What do you guys think?,post,"**\*Above text is translated from Tamil to English\***

This text was posted in the Family Whatsapp group by my Aunt who is a school teacher. I want to refute them so bad but I couldn't articulate my words properly. Why are they with this backwards mindset?. Why Sex is still a taboo topic for here?

>""We should not teach these **uncivilized things** to our children""

>""This is not education. This is misdirection""

How can this be uncivilized and misdirection? This is what gives them the knowledge on what is right and wrong practices in sex. Actually, this is what protects teenagers from leaning in to bad practices in sex and prevents lot of bad consequences. Not having proper sex education is why teenagers fall into pornography in the first place.

Man I am so angry right now. I thought having a good government would lead a country to a better future but now that I realize that would never happen with this backward thinking people of our country, even if we get a good government like our current one.

  
**What do you guys think?**

1oshqdu,Ahangama and Tuktuk Mafia,post,"Hello guys 

I am a Tourist from Germany and Ive been in Sri Lanka for 2 weeks now, mostly in the south coast area.
First I want to say: I never thought I would love a country so fast and Ive traveled alot.
The regular people here are very kind and friendly.
And then you have the Tuktuk driver. 
We like to use Uber and PickMe to move around. But we had allready 2 situations when some Tuktuk Driver got mad as soon as we said that we have a PickMe Driver and they randomly wanted us to cancel that and drive with them - for a higher price of course lol.

One time they blocked the road and ganged up on our Driver, stole his phone and pushed him, glad the police was around although im not really sure they helped the right side because everybody wanted to put the blame on our driver instead. I told them it was not his fault obviously.

Prices are crazy too for a Tuktuk 

For example:
Tuktuk from Midigama to Ahangama: 1200 (2-4km)
Pickme: 385

Uber from Midigama to Galle: 3000 (25km)

How are the prices fair lol ofcourse tourists prefer the Apps!

Kind regards

1oso9zm,"I feel like Sri Lanka will never honestly change or develop, am I correct on this view?",post,"Genuine question, I know that we have a decent government (All I heard is that they are good and genuine, I'm not very political), but will this actually lead to any real improvement?

**I honestly find it hard to believe that Sri Lanka will ever change and here are some reasons**

*-* ***TLDR;*** *The main holder for everything I mentioned is --->* ***Our societal standards are lower than that of the average***\*.\*

1. No road discipline, people honk for literally the smallest thing, not something u see anywhere except here in south asia.
2. Food, etc being really unhygeinic, if you compare it to any country that is not south asia, it's really bad
3. People are reluctant to change, will protest for anything that puts them out of their comfort zone
4. We romanticize what's wrong (we make it normal in society), like **ragging** etc.
5. Absolutely no urban planning, Houses appear literally anywhere, roads aren't even planned, nor are neighourhoods.
6. People fighting over different parties in the parliment that lead to no good (I mean we have quite a few opposition leaders etc, idk much honestly regarding this topic)
7. We are literally known for always being late than scheduled, not doing work properly on time, and just not delivering to a certain expectation (government related services etc, literally the opposite of what some countries are known for).
8. We litter our own surroundings like it's second nature to us, people just don't think twice about throwing their wrappers, bottles etc to the ground after using it, I know this isn't everyone but it's still a fair amount
9. We don't have any advanced industries, when it comes to garbage etc, it's all lacking behind, we can't always keep using the war/government as an excuse.
10.  Spitting the betel leaf thing on the road, it's like just so normal now.

To summarise, I think our people are willing to change and adjust to any law etc in other countries but except our own, you can't always blame the government for everything, like streets that are littered, people not willing to work on time or properly etc.

For me, I thought about the multiple different ways our country could honestly be better, and I don't think it will ever happen without a dictatorship or something, atleast a proper one, democracy will get us nowhere, because you will have to satisfy a bunch on uneducated people or else you lose the vote. Idk this is just my view, even if we have a good government, our cities won't look like that of Japan, Malaysia, Singapore etc, I highly doubt it. The main problems we suffer from live deeply rooted within our socities etc. We are so reluctant to change that the people who want to change will just find themselves moving abroad and never coming back.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oso9zm/i_feel_like_sri_lanka_will_never_honestly_change/,1762707170.0
1osmi3z,"Trivializing Sri Lankan food by calling most savory dishes ""curry"" instead of using individual names",post,"As the title says, people call every dish they eat with a carb as ""curry"". For most people outside south asia, curry is just one specific thing and the whole uniqueness of a dish disappears when you call it as such. For example, I've seen people call ambul thiyal as ""sour fish curry"" or eggplant moju as ""eggplant curry"". There are various cooking styles such as dry toasting (mallung), stir fries (themparadu), dry gravies, or even gravies without the use of any curry powder (such as miris malu or kiri hodi) which all get trivialized into ""curry"". 

I guess people wrongly translate the Sinhala word ""ව්‍යාංජන"" as ""curry"" when a better word would be ""accompaniments"". Now, one could say that there aren't any English names for most Sri Lankan dishes. But, is that really necessary? Nobody uses English names for dishes such as sushi, pad thai, biryani, rendang, pho, and so on. Even when there are ""English"" words, they don't mean much to someone outside Sri Lanka (hoppers or string hoppers are great examples). So, why not use the proper sinhala/tamil names?",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1osmi3z/trivializing_sri_lankan_food_by_calling_most/,1762702972.0

1ossevq,Should I go for a brand-new car with a big lease or stay within my comfort zone?,post,"Hey everyone,

Need some genuine advice here. I’m planning to upgrade my current vehicle and will have around 6 million LKR once I sell it.

Now, my family’s pushing me to go for something brand new around 10 million, like a Fronx or Perodua Ativa, with a 4 million lease. But honestly, I feel like that’ll just drain me — paying off a heavy lease every month isn’t something I want to stress over.

Personally, I’m more comfortable going for something around 6–7 million, maybe a Swift RS (2017) or similar, so that even if I take a small lease, it’s manageable.

So what do you guys think?
Is it worth stretching for a brand-new car and a big lease, or better to stay practical and avoid the financial pressure?

We live in a very noisy troublesome neighborhood and it's already mentally affecting us. To add on to that our grandmother who is bed ridden, has dimentia and she doesn't even sleep. She goes 2 days without sleeping and she always shouts, calling for people in the past, gets arguing. I kid you not when I say this, 2 minutes doesn't go by without she saying something and she also has this loud deeper voice which is just painful.

My mother and I look after her, but we have migranes because of all this noise and her. It has come to a point my mom doesn't even have the mental capacity to cook a meal at home. We have to beg, break down and cry for our grandma to shut the fuck up. Sometimes we even feel there's no point living anymore.

I got so mad I even screamed at her to shut up but it doesn't stop.

1osl6uq,"If you had to choose between your old mother and your future partner, who would you choose depending on your culture SL ?",post,"This question exposes more than emotions. It reveals your entire value system.

If you choose your mother, you are standing by loyalty, gratitude, and moral debt. She gave you life and raised you; you owe her everything. But choosing her also means clinging to the past instead of building your own. Eventually, she will be gone, and if you never built your own foundation, you will be left with regret and emptiness.

If you choose your partner, you are betting on creation, your future, your legacy, and your independence. You will likely face guilt, judgment, and emotional backlash for “abandoning” your mother, but that is the cost of growth and adulthood.

At the core, the choice reflects your stage of life:

If you are still emotionally dependent, you will pick your mother.

If you are ready to lead your own life, you will pick your partner. Not because you love your mom less, but because you honor her by living fully, not staying tethered.


If you were forced to choose in a real conflict, the hard truth is this:
👉 Choose the future. Your mother’s role was to raise you to stand on your own, not to keep you tied forever.

1ornrg7,It’s 2025 and apparently it’s still “illegal” for women to buy beer in Sri Lanka,post,"So I walked into a wine store today just to buy a beer — simple enough, right? Apparently not if you’re a woman.

The guy behind the counter looks at me and says, “Sorry, I can’t sell that to you. It’s illegal for women to buy liquor.” Then, as if that wasn’t absurd enough, he actually asks me if there’s a man with me who could buy it instead. Because obviously, women can’t be trusted with a can of beer.

And the cherry on top? He goes, “You can buy it from a supermarket, that’s okay.”
So it’s illegal here but magically legal next to the cereal aisle? Make it make sense 🤌

I just stood there wondering if I’d accidentally time-traveled back to the 1950s. It’s 2025, and women still have to argue for the right to buy a drink? Honestly, it’s both hilarious and depressing at this point.

I'm completely studied free education from grade 1 to UGC. Now I can proudly say that I'm a doctor but If it weren't  for free education, I would have gone to the sea to catch fish like my father & The matter is This man CWW.Kannnangara did a great job for our entire nation but he didn't get recognition well because of the ugly politics. He is not a Sinhala-Politician he is the politician of the nation just think about his vison Sri-Lanka was the first country to introduce free education from grade 1 to UGC to the world at 1943. Not only free education but also free breakfast & dresses & I'm recently saw a grade 5 Tamil book which has APJ.Abdhul-Kalam life story yeah he is good but see CWW.Kannangara is the reason of Sri-Lanka's today literacy rate but our peoples forgot him.

1orrk8l,Scam going on at Burley's??,post,"Okay so, I like helping beggars. I give them food once in a while whenever I have the opportunity. And it always makes me feel good. Today, I was hanging out with a friend at Burley's when suddenly, a little girl (who looked like a typical street kid) came to our table and asked whether we could buy her something from the menu. Honestly, we didn't know what to do. We have never experienced something like this before, so we were dumbstruck. So we just went with the flow and took her to the counter where the menu was. Then she pointed out one of the most expensive things on the menu (A submarine which is a new arrival). The thing is, she didn't even take time to decide what she wanted; it's as if she already knew what to get. That's the moment I realised that this most probably wasn't her first time doing this. But since we already gave our word, we bought it for her. 

Now here's the part where it gets more frustrating. While my friend and I were waiting for the food, she went to another table and asked the people there to buy her some food too. That's when I confirmed that we indeed got somewhat scammed.. I lowkey wanted to go there and warn those people, but then I thought that since she's doing this because she and her mother (who was waiting outside the whole time) were hungry, I might as well just stay out of it.. After the food came, she took it and didn't even thank us. But her mother came inside and thanked us.. 

  
At the end of the day, I know that we did a good thing. But I don't feel good about it like I usually do. I feel like our kindness was taken for granted. And I didn't like her attitude, as if she expected us to follow her orders. I get that this is completely our fault, that we should have refused her from the beginning. But it's obvious she has done this before, so hasn't the Burley's staff noticed this? The guys at the other table also went to the counter with the girl so surely, someone must have noticed this. Maybe the staff is not doing anything about it because it's none of their business and it would be more profit for them.. I don't know. All I know is that if something like this happens again, I'm going to refuse even if it's a kid. So yeah, I just wanted to warn anyone who plans on going to Burley's, so that they won't be caught off guard like we were.",63,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1orrk8l/scam_going_on_at_burleys/,1762614132.0

1orqme9,Google Wallet in Sri Lanka,post,"Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm no expert on this, but what do you all think is the reason why Google Wallet doesn't support Sri Lanka?

First of all, while the whole world is moving towards cashless payments, we're in the Stone Age, acting as if cashless payment is a crime. Even the tuk-tuk buggers are unlikely to accept card payments. Even third-class sellers refuse to accept cards, or if they do, they charge an extra 3%.

However, at least a certain number of places—at least in the Western Province and other major cities—have some shops and services that do (it's not great, but it's something). If you take as cashless payment as percentage. Still very low in whole country. If you are in a banking sector, you should know the data. Lanka QR is also a good initiative. I heard that according to the recent national budget, the charges are 0% for transactions less than Rs. 5000/-.

I was curious why we still cannot add our cards to Google Wallet. And no, I don't mean the BYBIT cards that Dilshan Abeygunawardena and that SL Geek dude promote because you still have to change your location and all that. Why can't we just add any of our local VISA or Master whatever bank cards to Google Wallet in the right way? Is someone blocking it, like how Sri Lanka Customs held up the BYD imports? Is there a mafia behind this, like Sri Lankan payment gateway operators who may not want it to happen? We all know there have been certain childish cases in different sectors like electric vs. fuel car mafia. Tuk-Tuk mafia with Uber and PickMe. Bus conductors do not like the prepaid cards like that. the list goes on and on.

But seriously, I don't understand the reason behind it. Is it regulatory and market structure issues, central bank issue or is there a mafia behind it—like how fuel car importers don't like electric cars to be imported? Or, I mean, do people like Bhasha (Helakuru) only want their own apps to be used for payment?

1oqppbr,Just saw this post on LinkedIn… and realized how far we still are from a modern mindset 😞,post,"I came across a LinkedIn post today by a fairly high-profile individual, a Deputy Minister, advertising for interns at the Ministry of Industry.

At first glance, it looks great: opportunities for research analysts, data analysts, and digital content creators. But then you read the fine print…

“You need to be an undergraduate from a local government university.”

That one line says so much about how far we still are from a modern, inclusive, merit-based mindset.

This isn’t to take a shot at SL local universities, there are incredibly talented students there. But limiting opportunities like this, especially for something that’s supposed to drive an industrial revolution, feels incredibly outdated and narrow-minded.

It’s just disappointing to see that even in 2025, we’re still clinging to these restrictive, box-ticking mindsets rather than focusing on skills, potential, and innovation.

Sri Lanka has so much untapped talent, both inside and outside the traditional university system. Until we start recognizing that, I’m afraid we’ll keep falling behind.

1or0gc8,Budget 2025 Public Transportation Allocation,post,"

Today, President AKD presented his second budget for the year 2026. First of all, what do you guys actually think about the budget?

I was never really interested in budget discussions before 2022, but after the financial crisis, I started thinking a bit deeper about the budgets that governments publish and what kind of real outcomes they produce within a year.

Anyway, the reason for this post is to get your thoughts on one specific area public transportation. I’ve been using public transportation daily for the past five years, both as a university student and now for work. I travel around 30–40 km daily using trains and public buses to and from Colombo.

Over the last five years, I honestly haven’t seen a single good improvement in public transportation, even with all the recent policy introductions that still haven’t been practically implemented in Colombo. If you’re someone who’s been traveling through Colombo Bus Stands or Fort Railway Station during this time, have you actually seen anything change for the better? As a daily traveler, do you feel any improvement in your quality of life?

Anyway, I’ll stop sharing my frustration here — you’re free to comment if you feel differently.

The main reason I’m posting this is because I saw in the news that the government has allocated 12,500 million LKR for importing vehicles for Parliament ministers. The President also stated that there will no longer be vehicle permits for ministers. At first, this might sound like a good move but the way I see it, public money will still have to be spent to manage and maintain these vehicles over the years.

Meanwhile, I also read that 3,600 million LKR which is just over a quarter of that amount  is being allocated to import 600 buses for the CTB for long-distance routes. That means each bus would cost around 6 million LKR. I’m not sure what kind of buses these are, but I’ve seen people mention that since this is a government purchase, it’s tax-free which makes me wonder, then, what kind of vehicles are we getting for 12,500 million LKR? 

12.5 billion for importing vehicles for personal luxury and 3.6 billion for a country with 20 million+ citizens shouldn't this be other way around. 

I also noticed another allocation of 3,300 million LKR for importing five trains. According to the Deputy Minister, by the time procurement ends and these trains actually arrive, it’ll be around 2028. If you’re someone who travels by train daily, you already know the situation — trains are being canceled or delayed even more than during the economic crisis. It’s honestly sad that these so-called ministers still can’t figure out the problem and are just asking people to wait until 2028.

As far as I know, the last time Sri Lanka imported commuter trains for short-distance routes was around 2013 — the S11 powersets. The trains imported after that were mostly for long-distance intercity travel. Nowadays, you see people hanging off the sides of trains without thinking twice about their safety — yet these so-called “genius” ministers are nowhere to be found.

And seriously, getting five trains in three years  what difference is that going to make? What are people supposed to do until then? If I remember correctly, the government also allocated over 500 million LKR in the previous budget for importing buses, but we haven’t seen a single one on the roads yet. Compared to other sectors, I honestly feel the allocation for public transportation is very low.

Personally, I believe improving the quality of public transportation is one of the best ways to enhance people’s quality of life — and it can have a massive positive impact on the country’s economy. These figures in the billions might sound big to some, but in reality, 3–5 billion LKR isn’t that much when you think about what’s needed to provide decent, basic public transportation — buses and trains — for the people.

If you’re interested, I’d really like to hear your honest opinions on this:

Do you think the government has made any justifiable improvements to public transportation over the past year?

Do you think it’s reasonable for ministers to ask for 2–3 more years to see any “real change,” when we haven’t seen even basic progress yet?

And finally — are you satisfied with the 2026 budget overall?",30,https://i.redd.it/lq72ald1dvzf1.jpeg,1762536202.0

1oqr6qw,5G Scam in Sri Lanka ----,post,"Since most Sri Lankans have short-term memory loss, I'm not quite sure if y'all remember the word ""5G."" Do you even remember when it was introduced to Sri Lanka, at least for name sake? As far as I believe, it was even before the Easter attack and covid19. Yet, we still have the same number of 5G signal towers with Dialog! Less than ten on the whole island.

They're only in certain areas like parts of Colombo, Negombo, Galle, and a few places like that. Not even in whole Colombo though.

But you know the shameless thing? These Dialog guys still shamelessly promote 5G campaigns. The only thing they have changed is the Dialog 5G logo, and even that was only slightly. Can you even believe that? This is real—not a joke, not sarcasm. For real!! Meanwhile, our phone companies promote 5G phones with cutting-edge slogans and all. Freaking awesome. There are third party 5G routers available to purchase though.

There are a lot of places where even 4G is not available. 5G is just hilarious. In China, correct me if I'm wrong, they already have 6G in limited areas. At the very least, we don't even have 5G in the Western Province, which has the most potential customer base.

When we call the Dialog hotline, the customer service reps, who are trained to provide lies, say the usual: ""It will be released soon."" That's the same excuse they've been giving for the past five or six years. It's just that the shameless marketing team runs campaigns from time to time, but the actual product is not available.

In most civilized and developed countries, you are not allowed to do such things. But we Sri Lankans don't have such restrictions anyway, so they promote it shamelessly. TRCSL is sleeping anyway. Not quite sure but there was a rumor, TRCSL was the reason 5G is restricted in Sri Lanka but then again no clue why Dialog still promoting it. It's not illegal to promote since they have few towers but isn't that just hilarious.

And she was like very close to me, I mean she told her private things to me and she has a boyfriend. No words for the boyfriend, he is very loving boyfriend as she was telling and as I have seen. But, I really wanted a close girl best friend. That's not the case, few months earlier, she began to change like trying to avoid me or something. So what I mean is, back in few months earlier, I was like how are you, are you going home, like that I asked dumb qs being trouble for her. I was being dumb ass person to ask those things. I think that's the cause of change, but when I ask if she is angry with me or something like that and she said ""no with my boyfriend also I don't message a lot now"". Another incident is that she is doing a YouTube channel and I was helping by saying mistakes and stuff but I don't know I was like too much for those things and too much for caring. However, today she called me asking for a group thing and she was like a total stranger, she speak like that. I don't know what's wrong with me, I didn't had this close girl best friend before I don't know I have done anything wrong. I want your guys ideas about this with your experiences about this types of friend problem and stuff. so that I can get an idea. And by the way I can just directly ask from her that a I being like too much and stuff like that. But I can't because she did told me a incident about something and the incident is someone is telling that he is sad and all of these because of her and I don't want that to happen to he. That's why I am not going to ask from her directly I don't know man.

WARNING: This story contains details of murder, including of children, and mentions thoughts of suicide.

A 20-year-old man has pleaded guilty to murdering four children, their mother and a close family friend in a mass stabbing in Ottawa last year.

Febrio De Zoysa has also pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder for his attack on the father of the family, Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, who was seriously injured.


At the time of the stabbings on March 6, 2024, De Zoysa was a 19-year-old international student living with the Wickramasinghes in their basement in Ottawa's Barrhaven suburb.

He was arrested at the scene without incident and charged with six counts of first-degree murder the following day. 

6 dead including 4 children in Ottawa mass killing
De Zoysa stood with his lawyer Ewan Lyttle in Superior Court in Ottawa Thursday morning and pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder of the following victims:

- Ranaya Wickramasinghe, the family's three-year-old daughter.
- Ashwini Wickramasinghe, their four-year-old daughter.
- Inuka Wickramasinghe, their seven-year-old son.
- Gamini Amarakoon, 40, a close family friend and one of the family's two tenants.

The sentences for those murders are automatic: life in prison with no ability to apply for parole for 25 years.

For the remaining two victims — mother Darshani Ekanayake, 35, and her baby Kelly Wickramasinghe, just two months old — De Zoysa pleaded down to the lesser offence of second-degree murder. Pleading down is common in plea bargains.",10,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/febrio-dezoysa-ottawa-barrhaven-stabbing-2024-trial-9.6967788,1762477831.0

1oprgx5,A Follow Up to My Last Post about BYD Customer Service (My take on this has changed slightly),post,"So, Last Friday I posted a [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1okyu6e/if_youre_considering_buying_a_byd_think_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about how bad BYD customer service has been in my experienced, and some asked me to provide a follow up about it so here it is.

The very next day (Saturday morning) they sent me photos of the finished vehicle, but I couldn't collect it right away because I need some release documents from the insurance company. So I collected my vehicle on Monday, and they had done a pretty good repair on it.

  
When I asked about the bad service, here's the reasons they provided:

\- They had missed a couple of parts in the initial estimation, and they had had to get them imported. And when importing, apparently the customs clearing process had taken a long time because the lawsuit that's been going on.

\- As a couple of redditors mentioned in the last post, they initially had not expected this much sales when they started to import. It had been 8 times more imports than they expected, so they've been struggling to scale so quickly, both in terms of warehouse facilities and employees.

\- When I confronted him about the terrible customer service, he just showed his call log with 200+ missed calls only within that day, and said they are really running short of employees and it has been really too much work for him to handle on his own, and said he's been working till 2-3 am every day, for the past couple of months. Even though that is not the most professional thing to say from his end, he seemed genuine and I really felt bad for him specially since I was mainly disappointed at the ""unprofessional behaviour of their employees"" when the issue was really with the company. After all they're also just employees working for a company, and to get a 10000 word rant on Reddit after working till 2 am must've been awful. On the plus side, he told me that they hired some new employees recently and that they're being trained atm.

  
On some closing notes, you still have to think twice when buying a BYD, not really because of the reasons I mentioned in the last post (bad employees), but because of the reasons some mentioned in the comments: the company is kinda struggling to keep up with the unexpected growth, but they will eventually catch up.

I really feel bad for going at the employees that hard lol. I even took some advice from a comment and reached out the dude's manager to report them. Which I now think I shouldn't have done.

Also, I think this post will not be very well received like the last post complaining them simply because how different my takes are in the two posts. But I thought I owed a follow up so that's why I made this post anyway. An also, in general rants tend to do well in this subreddit lol.

  
That said, like you might've guessed already I'm a bit gullible person so take all of these with a grain of salt.",206,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oprgx5/a_follow_up_to_my_last_post_about_byd_customer/,1762409948.0

My partner and i arrived 3 days ago, we had a couple of days in Negombo and now headed to Pinnawala. Are we completely out of season? Or have we got unlucky and hit tourist traps. We’re not really finding much in the way of good food nor is anyone overly helpful. 
We’re here for 4 weeks and our plan was to go clockwise around the country with our next stop being Sigiriya then Kandy. 
The weather isnt looking in our favour either. What would you suggest? we’re open to ideas.
We love nature and hiking, we want to get involved with locals and see your culture and cuisine as well :) 

We can’t decide whether it might be better to go to the south first and down our trip counter-clockwise due to the weather in the central areas at the moment. 

Our original route and plan is;

Pinnawala → Sigiriya → Kandy → Nuwara Eliya → Ella → Gal Oya → Udawalawe → South Coast

She dresses well, nothing extreme, but every time she wears something slightly revealing, someone (a friend, cousin, older relative) finds a reason to comment or scold her. The thing is, she’s always careful.. she only goes out dressed like that when she’s with me or her mom, never randomly walking around alone or anything.

I just don’t get why people care so much. If she’s comfortable and safe, what’s the issue? Is it jealousy, outdated thinking, or just Sri Lankan culture being stuck in a loop? Genuinely curious how others see this.

1opxii8,Sri Lankan parents - are they mostly emotionally unavailable?,post,"Seen a few posts on this recently. In Sri Lanka, parents can be emotionally immature. Many are distant, self-involved or rejecting, while all the time controlling every aspect of thier kids. For example, the mom has to tell her older teenage son what shoes to wear for a wedding. Parents will not allow kids to take any small inconsequential decisions. Kids grow up unable to think for themselves and keep depending on parents for even small decisions. 

It drives me nuts when moms make their whole life about the child - in a very suffocating way. The kid internalizes a wierd idea of what love is - it is control. Guess what they will do to their life partners?

Im currently looking for something that is good for coding and editing and stuff since i plan on going forward with Interactive media or SE.

my current choices are-
1. Macbook m4
2. MSI Modern 15
3. Asus A15 TUF

So a few things to consider-
1. I currently have a mac. And I love macs and as far as I am aware they support coding and graphics well too.
2. But I want to game. Which is not possible on macs as it is not compatible with AAA games.
3. some softwares used in uni (notepad++, Mmlogic) etc and some other softwares used to teach in uni are not compatible as you may know
4. I can buy something with a touch pad or flexibility too if i buy a windows (msi modern 15. i saw on tiktok)
So im really torn about what to get. I am someone who loves the ""apple comfort"" but i dont want to rely on that comfort and buy something that wont be worth it if i cant even download a software needed for uni since thats the whole purpose of buying one.

I would love to hear the SE and Comp sci people's opinions on the sub on what i should do.

1opg0g5,I think I just realised my parents never really loved me for me,post,"Sorry for the long post, but I recently came to a painful realisation that my parents didn’t actually love or even like me growing up. Looking back, what I thought was love was more like control or conditional approval.

I spent my whole life trying to earn their love by performing, achieving, being the “good” child, thinking one day I’d finally be enough. But when my partner loved me just for being myself, without expectations, I finally understood what real love feels like. And it broke me a bit, realising I’d been chasing something that could never be earned from my parents.

For some context:
	•	My mum talks a lot but barely ever listens. Whenever I open up about how I feel, she invalidates it right away and goes back to whatever topic she wants to talk about.
	•	My dad doesn’t seem to process emotions at all. His advice for everything is to “keep yourself busy” like doing another course instead of addressing the pain or the past.
	•	My younger brother was very abusive towards the girls in the house, but he always got away with it because he’s the “younger one.” I think he turned out so sexist partly because of my mum’s internalised misogyny.
	•	My sister keeps telling me “that’s just typical Sri Lankan parents” and that I should accept it.

But I can’t help wondering, is this really normal? Do some parents just have children to use them as pawns for their image, rather than because they genuinely wanted kids?

It hurts because I still genuinely love and care for them. Yet every time I did something well, they’d somehow find a way to gang up and tear me down again, like they didn’t want me to do better than them.

It’s really confusing and sad to process all this, especially in a culture that expects you to honour your parents no matter what.

Has anyone else here felt like their parents cared more about their reputation than their child’s wellbeing? If so, how are you dealing with it? ",67,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1opg0g5/i_think_i_just_realised_my_parents_never_really/,1762378500.0

1op9h9c,SimplyTek Sri Lanka charging 3.8k+ for store pickup — is this normal?,post,"Hey everyone,

Has anyone else noticed that SimplyTek Sri Lanka’s delivery and convenience fees have become ridiculously high? I was about to place an order worth around 77,000 LKR, and they’re asking for nearly 4,250 LKR just for delivery. Even if you choose store pickup, they still charge 3,850 LKR!

To me, that feels really unfair — and honestly a bit misleading. The listed prices look attractive at first, but when you actually proceed to checkout, you suddenly get hit with an extra 4,000 LKR in fees. That completely changes the final cost and doesn’t feel transparent.

Has anyone else experienced this recently? Are people still buying from SimplyTek despite these charges? It’s frustrating to see such high “convenience” fees, especially when you’re not even asking for delivery.

Curious if this is a recent change or if I just got unlucky with my order.

1opsxva,Sri Lankan Police Clearance issue – NIC not found in DRP system. Do we need to send NIC physically to Sri Lanka?,post,"Hi all,

I’m helping a Sri Lankan friend who currently lives in Luxembourg. She needs to get a Sri Lankan Police Clearance Certificate, but when applying online the system says that her NIC number cannot be found in the DRP (Department for Registration of Persons) database.

She definitely had an NIC before, but it seems her details were never digitized / recorded properly in the new system.

We are trying to understand the correct process.

Questions:

1. Does she need to apply for a new Smart NIC through the Sri Lankan Embassy in Brussels so her information gets registered again in DRP?


2. How long does it usually take for the Police Clearance system to recognize the new NIC after the embassy submits it?


3. Does the NIC card need to be physically sent to Sri Lanka for processing, or is everything handled electronically by the embassy and DRP?


4. If she can’t travel to the embassy soon, can she give Power of Attorney to someone in Sri Lanka to handle the NIC registration / Grama Niladhari part on her behalf?


5. Has anyone here gone through this recently — any timeline or advice?

6. Is there anyone here works at Department Registration of Persons (Sethsiripaya)? 


We are mainly unsure whether the physical NIC card needs to be couriered to Sri Lanka, because we want to avoid risks of it getting lost.

Any guidance or real experience would really help. Thank you!

1op4nss,"So, how do I say ""give me more money bro"" professionally?",post,"Jokes aside, I need some advice on whether I should 1. Ask for a raise in the first place 2. If yes, what's the best way to go about it 
Here are a few details : 
I switched careers last year (2024) in November and moved to finance at 25 years old.  
Prior to my career switch, I had around 2.5 years of experience as a Junior Analyst but it was in a different field so my boss said they'll give me a junior Analyst position and a salary of LKR 130k (gross). He said that we can increase it later on after my probation if im good.
My probation ended in May 2025 and my salary didnt change. I got a little upset over it because I was expecting a raise because my seniors kept telling me I was good and one day one of them took me aside and said that everyones impressed with me so if by chance my boss doesnt give me a raise when my probation is done, to ask for it. This is the part where I was a bit dumb - when I got the fixed contract I didnt read it properly  because my boss was talking to me so I just signed the contract but when I looked at it properly a few minutes later after the meeting with my boss i realised I didnt get a raise. I was disappointed and honestly demotivated but too scared to ask my boss about it and thought that maybe ill wait a year to ask for a raise. Exactly a year has passed now, and I think its time I should ask for a raise. What do you guys think? At 26, isnt 130k really low given the current times (i think it is) ?  And whats the best way to ask? ",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1op4nss/so_how_do_i_say_give_me_more_money_bro/,1762353674.0

1opaqsi,Feedback Needed Drop yours,post,"Feedback need guys❤️

Hey everyone,

I’m currently building a lingerie and wellness brand designed for Gen Z and young adults but with a different vision than most existing brands.

My goal isn’t to sell “sex appeal,” but to redefine intimacy and confidence helping people feel comfortable in their own skin, understand their preferences, and connect with themselves in a healthy, aware way.

I did a test run for about a year and made over 2,800 physical sales through small-scale marketing and direct community reach. Earlier, I tried partnering with an e-commerce platform (during the COVID era), but after I refused their commission model, they ended up copying my entire concept and product range. That experience pushed me to go independent.

Now, I’m preparing for my first official public launch this time in collaboration with healthcare  professionals to keep the focus on awareness and education, not just aesthetics.

Before I move forward, I’d love your thoughts as people who actually represent this generation:
	•	What do you think our generation is missing when it comes to body confidence and awareness?
	•	What would make you trust and engage with a brand in this space?
	•	What kind of products or campaigns feel authentic — not oversexualized or performative?

The business is fully registered and licensed, and I’m currently working on refining the storytelling and experience to make it something real, inclusive, and relatable.

Would love your honest feedback and ideas ❤️

1ooxgal,Customs holding packages and requesting insane tax amounts,post,"Hey folks, wanted to raise a question in the community on if this has happened to anyone else the past few months. 

I’ve been regularly ordering small-medium sized packages (think action figures and model kits) from Japan through EMS and they’ve always been delivered to my local post office with no issues. A couple months ago, around September, every single package I’ve ordered (all from the same website and same sizing plus prices) have been held by customs. 

The taxes vary by the custom officers moods and once I even received a ridiculous amount of 55k for three packages, and they “kindly” reduced it down to 26k. This is just absurd. Especially given that packages are just getting held up for no rhyme or reason, when asked why they say it’s the pricing but when I point out I’ve ordered stuff for the same amount before with no issues they don’t say anything. 

My best guess is they’re doing this to meet their tax goals for the year or something. I don’t get how every single package has been getting held up otherwise. I’ve seen even the tiniest stuff like a single tshirt getting held up.

Has this happened to anyone else? Did you also notice a shift like this recently? ",57,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ooxgal/customs_holding_packages_and_requesting_insane/,1762331191.0

I've never come across such people who think they are entitled to free money. 

They operate like those thugs/loan shark you see on tv.

I was shocked when i heard them talk like that, very threatening and abusive with their language. You would think at least the owner would know how to talk decently, but nope. Not her. Not Kosh. These same people go on talk shows and stuff, and people keep giving them platforms...this needs to stop. 

Also, they exploit young creatives for their portfolio shoots... promising that if they shoot at no cost,  they will let them use those images on their personal portfolios. And after the shoot they back out and pretend  they never agreed to that. How do I know this? My friend was at the receiving end of all this. 

The fucked up part is that these people are crushing the dreams of young and hopeful newcomers to the fashion/creative industry. To anyone who reads this, please avoid them like the plague.

So I am a guy from a Jaffna Tamil family raised in a Hindu environment but I have recently learned about the beauty of Islam. I had moved to Canada after the age of 10 with my family, and it is here that I was embraced by so many wonderful Muslims of various backgrounds in university and came to learn more about their faith. My parents are very supportive of my decision as they believe in the validity of all religions. However, a friend of mine had told me that if I were to fully revert, that I would no longer be considered a Tamil because Sri Lankan Muslims (Moors) are a unique community and are not Tamils according to official Sri Lankan regulations? Would I therefore be considered Moor now?

Growing up I guess I was surrounded by our typical Jaffna style cooking, clothing, language, etc and of course I am aware of the somewhat odd ways of how we Lankans classify ourselves. I have always considered myself as a Tamil person with a Sri Lankan nationality, but would this change if I reverted to my new faith that gives me so much peace? Would there be any issues with paperwork if I were to permanently return to my home country some day? Is there an exception to any documentation issues because Muslim people speak in Tamil?

How long the full process usually takes if I go at that time?

1ootemp,Baahubali - The Eternal War Part 1 Teaser (Tamil). Why haven't our country tapped into it,post,"I am an animator, and I was really worried that our country does not have an animation industry. I create animated shorts and submit it to film festivals, 

 brief story about myself, I create animated shorts and submit it to film festivals, 

 when I said about animation to my family other people, they mocked me for getting into children's field and they did not have any understanding about it. 

They told there is no any stable job in animation and did not let me study it, but i managed to learn by myself for nearly 10 years and I can create animations. But no one in sri Lanka gave me support or encouraged me, everyone was just ignorant. 

Animation industry has been existed for more than 80 years now and still we have never explored it. All our people know is a few professions and never consider the talents of individuals. 

Let's see the truth, an average sri Lankan youth knows to operate a smart phone but not a computer. Because our education system is completely focused on theory than practical. We only manufacture scholars not talented people. We are blocking the creativity of our youth. 

I just saw this and India is getting in top of the game of animation. We always whine about countries like India but never thought of developing ourselves. When I wanted to study animation there were no standard institutions to teach them. Even our state universities does not even have a proper course for Vis. com (visual communication) (we are so backwards)

Are we done being ignorant. Just look at this, I feel sad that our country have is still conservative people and not letting us explore various fields. It was actually really hard to find an animation community in sri Lanka and still consider animation is just kid stuff. 

We don't have dreamers, innovators and creative people instead we create ripoffs from others. I have peo tv and they advertise some animations in sri lanka. Man, they look like made in the 90s. Really poorly made for the sake. We lack the newness are the talent of trying something new. I see many people running for tuitions everyday but no one seem to  learn something new that are not taught in our books or schools. 

We are always good at reasoning, they would say we don't have the audience or market to invest in animation. Actually, it's easy to establish a animation studio than big manufacturing companies. But we will never do that. Because we are always living in the older times. scared of exploring new stuff. From adults to children everyone are in a system that never let us think differently.

When will we make something like these. We are still amateurs.

1on7hoc,The Simple Trick to Bypass Customer Care Bots and Talk to a Real Human Fast!,post,"**TL;DR:** Save the customer service number with a **comma** and the button sequence (e.g., `0117100100,11411`) to jump the robot line and talk to an agent immediately!

\--- ✄ -----------------------

The key to bypassing the long menu options (the IVR) and speaking directly to an agent is using the **comma (**`,`**)** in your saved contacts.

* **What it does:** The comma acts as a **""pause""** when dialing. (one comma for \~2 secs pause, two for \~4 secs pause ..)
* **How to use it:** Find the sequence of buttons needed to reach a human agent (e.g., 1-1-4-1-1). Save the number with the comma and the sequence immediately after the main digits.

**NOTE:** Using a `;` instead of `,` will ask for your confirmation for sending the sequence.

**Example:**

If the main number is `0117100100` and the path to a human is `11411`, save the number as: `0117100100,11411`

Your phone dials the number, **pauses** after connecting to the automated system, and then **automatically inputs the** `11411` **sequence** for you, connecting you straight to the agent queue.

**Few Tested Examples:**

1. Dialog Broadband Hotline : `0117100100,11411`
2. Mobitel Post Paid Hotline : `0712755777,,262`  \- Extra `,` For a longer pause, Mobitel needs a longer pause.
3. CEB Hotline (without acc. number, faster) : `0112266266,14**` \- Double `*` to skip entering the account number (It doesn't have to be a star).
4. CEB Hotline (with acc. number, slower) : `0112266266,14[ACCOUNT_NUMBER]1` \- replace `[ACCOUNT_NUMBER]` with your 10-digit account number.
5. Combank Generic Hotline: `0112353353,14`
6. Combank Digital Hotline: `0112353353,129`
7. Dialog Post Paid Hotline : `0777678678,1#`  \- `#` to skip the lengthy voice-over.

**Where This Trick is Most Useful:**

This trick saves you the most time whenever you call a number with a predictable menu system. Here are a few places you can use it:

* **Customer Care Hotlines:** (Dialog, Mobitel, Banks) - Getting straight to a **billing** or **technical support agent**.
* **Bank Hotlines:** Quickly getting to the **Credit Card department** or freezing a lost card.
* **Hospital and Clinic Bookings:** Bypassing the operator and getting straight to the **appointments desk** (especially those busy hospital lines).
* **Insurance Companies:** Directing your call to the **Claims department**.
* **Government/Utility Services:** Reaching the specific desk for **connection or payment inquiries**.",305,https://i.redd.it/5ku26hx3h0zf1.jpeg,1762162802.0

🍛 Food / Local Culture: Any must-try local restaurants, markets, or cultural experiences that aren’t overly touristy?
☀️ Weather: What’s the weather typically like in early December? Any areas we should avoid due to rain?

Basically we’re after a balance of hiking, beach relaxation, good food, and late-night vibes — all while soaking in authentic Sri Lankan culture.
Any suggestions (itinerary ideas, local events, places to stay, or insider tips) would be hugely appreciated!

Thanks in advance 🙏

1oo0xq4,"Looking for Advice on the Best Bank for Savings, Online Payments & Happy rates.",post,"I’m planning to open a new bank account mainly for savings, online payments (both international and local), and general personal use.

   I already have an account with **NSB,** but I’m not really happy with the benefits they offer. I also got a MasterCard from them (which is actually a Visa card) specifically for international online payments, and guess what, it still doesn’t work. They told me I needed to fill out a form to activate international transactions, which I did twice. Both times it was rejected for some ridiculous reason (their excuse is the signature i use to sign in form and signature in my Id needs to be exact same, like a copy, no same-match)

I know it’s a bit naive to expect good digital services or flexibility from a government bank, but compared to other state banks, NSB’s rates and benefits felt lower overall. Private banks aren’t really my first choice due to financial risk concerns, but I don’t mind considering Commercial Bank since it feels more stable. also in the Stocks too..

So I want to hear from you all..
• Which banks are you using?
• How are the interest rates, online payment options, and international transaction support?
• Are their mobile apps reliable and user-friendly?
• Any pros/cons or personal experiences would help a lot.

1onexcv,Don’t waste your money studying at BCAS Kandy Campus,post,"I'm currently studying at "" BCAS Kandy Campus "", and honestly, I wouldn’t recommend this place for studying "" Software Engineering "".

The main reason is that "" what they show on their website is not what they actually teach "". The syllabus looks modern online, but in reality, they teach "" outdated content "" and give "" old assignments "".

They don’t teach any modern technologies, and even the software they use is outdated. Some subjects feel completely "" useless and unrelated "" to our field.

Even the "" assignments are poorly prepared "" — they contain "" a lot of grammatical errors "", "" incorrect question numbers "", and "" structural issues "". They don’t look or feel like **professional academic assignments** at all.

A few lecturers clearly struggle to deliver proper lessons and seem to "" lack knowledge "" about the subjects they teach. Because of this, I’ve started to "" doubt the qualifications "" of the lecture panel.

When it comes to the campus environment, it’s also disappointing. The "" canteen is in a terrible condition "" — I can’t even call it a canteen anymore because "" they don’t serve any food "", and I’ve even "" seen rats "" there. The "" library doesn’t have enough space "" for students to study, and sometimes we have to leave because some lecturers use the library for their own work.

Another issue is how they "" force students to buy things "". For example, they once tried to sell a t-shirt claiming it was “compulsory.” They also often say things like “if you don’t participate, you’ll be downgraded” or “bring proof that you attended” — especially for things like "" useless HSU meetings "".

They also once said we would go on a "" field visit "", but that "" never happened "". It was just an empty promise, and honestly, a "" complete lie "".

Finally, the "" reception staff is unhelpful "". I once asked for help with something important, but they didn’t care at all.

I am planning a trip to Sri Lanka in May. I understand the monsoon season will be starting on the west coast but the east side of the country should be OK.   
My issue is that I must fly in and out of Colombo and I am concerned I might get stuck in Colombo if the rainfall causes flooding/landslides.   
Unfortunately I cannot go on this trip any earlier in the year, I will be flying in on the second week of May, flying out the first week of June. Three weeks in Sri Lanka. 

Does anyone have any experience being in Colombo in May and travelling eastwards? How bad is the weather? did it disrupt your trip? Do flights get cancelled? 

I have been in Thailand/Malaysia at the start of their rainy season and found my travel was not disrupted. Heavy short showers, usually in the morning but no flooding. I am hoping the west coast of Sri Lanka might be the same.  


I have not booked flights yet as I am doing my research first. If anyone has been in Colombo in May/June I would love to hear your experience as I am considering not going to Sri Lanka because of my fear of being stuck in Colombo. 

I understand that nothing is guaranteed but if there is a strong possibility my trip will be disrupted then I will opt for a different country and visit Sri Lanka at a more suitable time of year.

1on0q6a,DONT GO TO SPOKEN ENGLISH CLASSES TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE.,post,"So recently I have seen an inclined rate in Spoken English Classes in Sri Lanka. Every time when I am scrolling through Facebook a teacher comes out with a made up accent stating its the best class bla bla and you dont need to have the vocabulary to speak English. I dont know if any of those online classes for adults are working for the ones who are going. But if you need a paper qualification for a certain promotion you should probably do a Diploma or something but if you are trying to learn English to use in your day to day life dont ever step into an online class because that wont be effective in the long run and it will be a loss of your time and money. My personal experience in learning English is reading a book out loud ,reading subtitles out loud in a movie, Chatting with a foreigner and this one is kinda personal favorite of mine and it has given me a vast knowledge of the English vocabulary, idioms and slangs and that is going through old school raps. I have scrutinized every damn word and I have learned many new words to enhance the language. So basically what I am trying to say is you only need to have the eagerness to learn the language. When you have the need it automatically transforms your brain to achieve that goal using any means necessary. Because a teacher will teach you every word and every grammar in a class but after that its all up to you explore and learn. I have seen many people who went abroad with only a little knowledge of english becoming pros in speaking English. So its all up to you lads. Write,read,explore, talk with yourself in English by imagining yourself in an interview or try to talk about something you love about in English. At first you will fail but over time you will have the confidence and the skill to talk about anything anywhere anytime. You only wanna know the ABCs in the alphabet. You dont need grammar. Just forget about it and read every book out loud and listen to native English speakers to see how they pronounce their words. This is a language not rocket science. So dont waste your time going to online classes. Invest that time to read an article or a book in English. When you are reading out a language it also boosts your confidence to speak it. Confidence is the key to learn a new language and reading out loud and talking it out loud with yourself while you are alone will boost it. The beginning wont be easy. You will fail and get mocked by wannabe posh lankans if you mispronounce a word. But remember their mocking will be your success to be better in every damn way possible!!!

1ongddk,Has anyone in Sri Lanka ordered books from Blackwells? Need advice on taxes and process!,post,"Hey everyone,

I'm hoping to get some clarity from those of you who have imported books directly from Blackwells UK.

Like many of you, I usually rely on our local online stores (jumpbooks, CGA, Flashbooks.lk, pickabook.lk, Wild and the Sage, etc.) for my physical books, and my Kindle for everything else. But I've been wanting to order a specific book that's hard to find here, and Blackwells says they ship to Sri Lanka.

I actually placed an order, but cancelled soon after for a couple of reasons:

1.  Taxes & Hidden Costs: The final price only showed the book cost and said shipping was included. It didn't add any separate import taxes or customs fees. I've heard horror stories about having to pay a lot extra to the post office here upon delivery.

2.  Payment Timing: My card wasn't charged immediately. I read that Blackwells only deducts the money when the item is dispatched. This is different from what I'm used to, and it made me a bit nervous.

So, for those who have taken the plunge:
a) What was your final experience like? Were there any surprise charges from Sri Lanka Customs or the post office when you received your package?
b) How does the payment work? Was it smooth, and did the amount charged at dispatch match your initial order total?
c) How long did shipping take? Are we talking weeks, or over a month?

Any clarity or advice would be massively appreciated! It would be great to know if this is a reliable option for getting books that aren't available locally.

1omlu6d,Has modern media failed Sri Lanka in race relations?,post,"Seeing some posts about a Tamil DJ facing racial abuse. Also seeing baby haamu (you know who) getting more and more media visibility...

When I was a kid, my favourite music video was J Town Story by Iraj and co. It completely changed the way I think about ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. As a Sinhalese, I stopped thinking from black and white terms about everything. I started reading about people like Gandhi, Mandela and realised that they were not black and white people. I honestly thought artists like Yathavan, Infaas, Gajan and Dinesh were amazing because they looked like people I encountered everyday in Colombo.

But that was the last time I was genuinely moved by Sri Lankan media.

Nowadays I look around and I cannot see any representation in popular media. Maybe I am looking at wrong places.

Mega teledramas are all representing Sinhalese. Are there any good tamil/ moor representation?
Who is the new Gajan and Dinesh?
Do I have to step into my liberal bubble to see other cultures represented?
Why there are no Tamil politicians in my screen? Why all the political discussions in Sinhalese? Are we excluding Tamil community from political debate?

For me, politics is always downstream from culture. If you do not change the culture, you cannot change politics. I think we are stuck and waiting for a saviour to save us. I think it's time the media executives in big companies to step up. It's time for us to demand better and positive representation.

* Counselor does not disclose personal details - unless it is highly relevant to your situation. 
* The therapy session is not a tea party - the counselor doesn't waste you money talking pleasantries.
* COunselor doesn't dish out advice - but guides you to open up your thinking and come to your own decisions. 
* Counselor doesn't doze off. 
* You don't feel ridiculed or shamed. 
* As therapy progresses, you begin to see where it is heading. 
* Counselors remembers you and your story.

That aside, if you’re middle class or lower, a government university is the most viable, cheapest, and best option for you.

I’m based in **Sri Lanka** and I need **short courses (around 3 to 6 months)** related to **DevOps, Data Analytics, or FinTech**. Ideally, the teaching should be **in English**, and I’m open to both **online or in-person** programs.

Also, if there are any **seniors or professionals** here who’ve taken a similar path, I’d love to hear your thoughts:

1om6wqs,What’s Really Going On With Sri Lankan IELTS Classes?,post,"My brother recently got an internship, so he started preparing for IELTS. We spoke to several IELTS ads on Facebook and, Jesus Christ, they were absolutely bullshitting. They claim all sorts of things, but some of them can’t even pronounce basic words. I’m sure there are good ones too, but this was another level. They kept harassing us to register, and then it turns out the “class” is 50+ students in an online session where everyone just sits in front of the screen, takes notes like it’s A/Ls, or spends the whole hour doing writing tasks, not even in a proper mock exam environment.
So we decided to go with self-study and found a really good mock exam and feedback platform. So fingers crossed for this arrangement. Please think twice before you get trapped by these so-called IELTS gurus. Do your research before you pay. We later found out that one of the teachers was just a random guy in Romania with zero English qualifications and who has never even taken IELTS himself.

Just thought of leaving this here.

I have already contacted some monasteries yet no body has so far replied - but is someone able to recommend me somewhere? It would be amazing if some locals know of a place where I can join. My plan is to spend 5-7 days at a monastery and join the teachers in their daily schedule. My preference is somewhere in a forest, but I'm not exactly spoilt for choice:)

1ommsq6,First-time visitors - rate our itinerary,post,"My wife and I are traveling to Sri Lanka (from the US) for a week in late January and (with ChatGPT's help) have put together a general idea of an itinerary, but would love the community's thoughts on it.  Some notes: we're heading to the Maldives for a few days afterwards, so beaches aren't a top priority; we've been on safari a few times (both in India and in Africa) so things like elephant-watching aren't a top priority; she's most interested in birding, with a little bit of culture (temples etc.) in the mix as well; we're getting to the middle-aged stage where creature comforts are welcomed over truly rustic experiences. Oh, and we'd hire a driver for the week. With that in mind, here's what we've sketched out:

Jan 28: Land in Colombo in the wee hours of the morning. *Probably* have a driver pick us up and take us to Sigiriya (Jetwing Vil Uyana).  Alternatively, see if we can find a boutique hotel to catch up on a few hours' sleep, but we got business class flights on miles so hopefully will be at least somewhat rested.

Stay in t for two nights. View Royal Gardens, do some hiking, some birding (Ritigala?), relax

Jan 30: Drive to Kandy via Matale spice gardens and/or Aluvihara. Stay at W15 Hanthana Estate two nights. Visit Temple of the Sacred Tooth, Udawattakele Sanctuary for birding

Feb 1: Take the Blue Train from Kandy to Nanu Oya, then transfer to Ceylon Tea Trails for one night.

Feb 2: Spend the day at Tea Trails; do some hiking or kayaking, then drive to Sinharaja (Boulder Garden resort) for two days - birding w/ naturist, hang by the pool, etc.

Feb 4: morning at Boulder Garden, then drive to CMB for an early evening flight to Male.

Thoughts? Recommendations? (I know many people prefer less of a moving around vacation, but we're pretty comfortable with changing scenery every couple of days and prefer to try to squeeze more in, if we're able - especially because it sounds like the drives themselves will be quite scenic!)",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ommsq6/firsttime_visitors_rate_our_itinerary/,1762103297.0

I would like your opinions and feedback especially if anyone of you **own any of the following brands or are seriously considering** other than BYD (because i've already seen plenty of feedback on BYD).

Primary use is for his daily errands; he will use the vehicle on a daily basis mostly driven within Colombo city limits with occasional outbound trip. Utmost priority is safety, comfort, and style in that order. Preference is for a family sized SUV (7-seater) and **i'm not considering anything above LKR 40Mn**.

I know the NEVs may incur significant depreciation (IMO) and could be a write-off down the line ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ and hence my focus is mainly on ICE/PHEV's. I just want to get him a good brand new car with agent/manufacturer warranty which he can use without any issues for 3-5 years before I swap it later on.

Options (prices based on a quick online research and I'm not sure if they are up-to-date):

**BYD** (I saw some posts here in Reddit regarding after sales issues at JKCG which is a concern. But being JKH I hope they will rectify it sooner than later.)

* 22Mn - Sealion 6 PHEV (will they launch Sealion 7 in SL soon? If so this is moot)
* 18Mn - Sealion 5 PHEV

**Chery** (wasn't my first choice, but the Tiggo 9 and the T2 looks great and they are closely behind BYD in China and are gaining traction with their new sub-brands Jetour and Omodoo/Jaecoo in other markets):

* 29Mn - Chery Tiggo 9 PHEV (concerned on the re-sale aspect)
* 26Mn - Jetour (by Chery)T2 (Luxury trim) PHEV (strong preference given the price)
* 23Mn - Jetour (by Chery) T2 PHEV

**Kia** (previously used one and I like the brand and better re-sale value than above for sure)

* 33Mn - Sorento
* 37Mn - EV9
* 35Mn - Carnival (MPV - a little too big for his use but looks good and priced well for this category)

**Hyundai**

* 37Mn - Santa Fe (not sure why some dislike the design; I think it looks good)

I have looked at other NEV offerings such as Changan/Deepal, DFSK, GWM, GAC, Leapmotor, Skywell and I'm not particularly impressed nor interested in them.

**Any other 7-seater SUV options that I should consider (even non PHEVs) in the above price range? If so please let me know.**",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1omacf0/midrange_suv_7seater_options_in_sl_for_late2025/,1762065122.0

1olggsp,My experience as a verbally abused by teachers in my school.,post,"I studied in one of the popular girls secondary elite school. I am from a rural area and studied in a small rural primary school. I entered in grade 6 with hopes and dreams. 
The experience?
It was worst.
Teachers treat students partially based on their backgrounds. Some people got princess treatment from teachers while us got only scolding from them. In gr 6, some girl from elite backround stumbled on my leg and fell on the floor, it was because I stretched my leg a little for numbness. She complained it to our neighbour classroom teacher, instead of ours. The teacher called me and made that girl go and then scolded me that I am the wrong one here because I stretched my leg, not her walking without looking. I still remember the impact even after years and years. I still remember another teacher bullied me in gr 6 because I don't know the exact name of my father's work and tried to describe it. She made me stand before those 30+ students and bullied gave me a name. For many months those classmates made fun of me of that name.
And one teacher scolded me, because I told her that I didn't know how to do the exercise in my english book, that's why I didn't do it. If that's from their favourite students, or elite students. They will go on a zen mode and even go to the end of the world to teach them. 
Why no one talk about these partiality? Partiality exist everywhere, but in childhood is terrific. 
Those events broke my confidence and everything. Even, sometimes I struggle to talk properly or stand out before others. The government is paying for teaching all students not for some particular elite people. We wear white uniform to show equity. But, is there any real equity? Nope.
Rural schools teachers way more better than those elite school teacher. After my experience, I didn't want to send my sister to that elite ***, and made her to study nearby. She's scoring good and teachers are very well dedicated.
And this is my experience, and there are many of them like me. Most of us silent about this matter, thinking that scolding is good for our life. Scolding for wrongs are important.
 But, these types of scolding? No. It'll destroy another child's life. Like it destroyed me.",99,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1olggsp/my_experience_as_a_verbally_abused_by_teachers_in/,1761976761.0

I’m planning to buy a 12,000BTU inverter AC and came across the Abans 12000BTU R32 Inverter Anti-Corrosion Air Conditioner. Model :  ABLGIN-12R32ANTI

1. How’s the cooling performance and power efficiency?
2. Is it quiet during operation?
3. Any issues with after-sales service or parts availability?
4. How does it compare to other brands like Hisense, TCL, or Gree?

1oljo0q,"Employee refusing to pay wages, should I ignore or fight back?",post,"Writing this here, cause I have no where to ask but there's the context,

Few weeks before. I did applied for a job, small and compact store and located at top floor. One person to handle everything Not many visiting customers. But as days passed by, things did started to get abit difficult for me, 

Example - hence the store is located at top floor its boiling heat. Only allowed to switch on the AC when customers come in but switching on the ceiling fan makes it worse. So I use to keep open the back door for ventilation. 

Another incident is water, The water is not always available, usually comes after 3pm. So if in any urgent case to use the Washroom I do have to hold till water comes 

I did tried managing for couple of days but it was tough, hence I joined for full time initially, they did said I need to sign a contact but after 2 week of joining no sign of contract so I thought this is the chance to leave. Cause it does not suite me, Talked with the owner and all cool parted ways.

Hence i worked for 2 straight weeks, made plenty of sales, I thought of asking the owner if I am eligible to receive the wages for days i have worked, the reply was hence me leaving caused them more trouble & they dont pay for induction days and hence there's no contract signed so they won't be any paycheck.

I'm struck whether should I leave it or fight back. Cause the wages comes near 18-19k.

Your opinions are appreciated 😊

1okyu6e,If you're considering buying a BYD... THINK AGAIN,post,"EDIT: Literally a day after I posted this (not saying it’s related, could be a coincidence), they sent me photos of the finished job.

EDIT: Made a [follow up post to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oprgx5/a_follow_up_to_my_last_post_about_byd_customer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), you might want to check that as well, since my thoughts from this post have changed.

TLDR: It's been two months for a simple repair and I still haven't received my vehicle from them.

So I bought my BYD a few months ago, and don’t get me wrong I love the car but this is about their after sales customer service.

So here’s the timeline:

* TWO MONTHS AGO (3rd of Sept): A bike hit me from the side, both front and rear doors were damaged in driver’s side.
* Sep 4 : I visited the BYD service center in Kurunegala, and they told me it will take months to get it done from there, and recommended me to get it done from their Colombo service center. So I contact a “service advisor” they appointed from Colombo showroom, and he asks me for some photos of the damaged parts so he can make an estimation to submit to the insurance company.

I of course submitted them right away, but heard nothing back from them.

A week passes by, still nothing, and they won’t respond to my calls. Then I decided to visit the Colombo service center and see what's up.

* Sep 11: I took my car to the service center, and the service advisor took some photos and I believe that's when he started preparing the estimation
* Sep 14: He finally sends me an estimation, and that had an incorrect model on it, and it took another two days for him to fix that.

After I receive the estimation, he said that all the parts have already arrived Sri Lanka, and we'll be able to start the repair process in a week.

Two more weeks pass by, nothing from them, the service advisor deliberately dodges my calls. Sometimes he would say something like ""I'm logging in to the system to check on this, and will get back to you right away"" and hangs up, and then again won't answer any of my calls for weeks. To say he was unprofessional would be an understatement.

He finally asks me to drop the vehicle off at Colombo service center at Oct 3rd.

* Oct 3rd: When I visit there, they again told me it would take another week if I do it from their colombo showroom, and asked me to drop it off at their newly opened Wattala service center. Once I visit Wattala, thei appointed a new service advisor, and he said basically this has been stalled for the past two weeks, and apparently the dude from Colombo had done nothing.

I was still cool with it, just dropped the vehicle off at Wattala and they said it would be ready by Oct 17 (spoiler alert, it was not).

From there onwards, they did not answer any of my phone calls/messages for two weeks, and their complains hotline was also useless.

* Oct 22: They sent me a couple of photos saying the repair process has started, and I was a bit relived, and they told me it will be ready by Oct 27 (spoiler alert, it was not).

The last week passes by they keeps delaying it, and told me they will finalise the documents with insurance by Oct 30, so I can come and collect the vehicle on 31st.

* Oct 30 (yesterday): I was prepared to visit there today (Oct 31st) and just to be sure, I made a call, and they told me some documents are still not ready with the insurance, and they will for sure get it ready by 31st evening so I can just come and collect the vehicle tomorrow morning.
* Oct 31 (today): I've made plans to visit there there tomorrow (mind you, I'm visiting there from Kandy) and called them to make sure. They asked me to collect a document from the insurance company, and after that I can collect the vehicle tomorrow.

So I called the insurance company and they said when their TO visited BYD workshop, the vehicle was still not done, and apparently they're asking me to come and collect the vehicle tomorrow because they know the insurance companies don't work on weekends and I for sure can't get the release documents from them tomorrow.

So afterall, it's been two months since I first reached them for a repair (a repair that would at most take 1 week. It's hardly even a repair. They just had to replace the parts) and still couldn't get it done. To make it worse, they have been very unprofessional throughout this, not transparent at all, been lying to get some more time. Not to mention, throughout these two months I had to constantly call them and see if the repair is progressing. Even then they would lie about the progress. It was so frustrating. It's safe to say that is is BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have received from any company.

If you're someone who's thinking of buying a BYD- think again.  
If you're someone who's already bought one- drive safely. Their aftersales service is worse than sh#t.",367,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1okyu6e/if_youre_considering_buying_a_byd_think_again/,1761927213.0

Sometime in the night I heard explosive sounds, I said to my self, our boys have had won the match and people are celebrating by lighting crackers.

But that day the sound I heard was different, not like crackers exploding In the distance, but had a deeper and profound sound. I got up and went to the tv lobby to check, if my family and friends were celebrating. 
Nope! They were outside, looking towards the sky.
Then it became apparent, the loud explosives were caused by AA guns, firing in to the night sky. Small lights were observed followed by the exploding sound I mentioned earlier.

Apparently, they were firing at the aircraft piloted by an terrorist. Fear quickly assimilated in our hearts,  electricity was cut off. 

I was the closest experience I had with war brewing outside our home. I felt helpless I had no place to go. Crippling fear I will never forget.

1olc3ai,I asked for your opinions about following IT degree at UOM or self-studying CS. Would BIT at UOM be a good alternative?,post,"Almost everyone seemed to say that I need a degree for credibility in the IT field. Backstory for people who didn't read my other post: I got selected into IT at the University of Moratuwa. I had asked for opinions about following a different plan without taking the conventional path of getting the degree. The plan was to complete all the CS50 courses and find my niche. And then complete courses to further advance it by following free or cheap courses provided by reputed universities.

If I make an addition to my plan with BIT from UOM, would it be a good alternative to following the IT full-time degree? I’m trying to research before settling on a plan. I'd feel better suited for an online degree than an onsite degree. Thanks in advance. I’d love your opinion.  
  
This is my plan instead of IT at UOM.

**Plan A**

Complete  
CS50 Python - Just started this  
CS50x  
CS50W  
CS50 SQL  
CS50 Cybersecurity  
CS50 AI

Find my niche. Take free or cheap courses from reputed colleges to further advance my knowledge. Plus, build projects along the way.

I might also look into OSSU.

1oknqv4,"Followed a strict 3-week diet plan, and my doctor completely shamed me for 3 cheat meals 😢",post,"Hi Reddit, I just need to vent because I’m still shaken.
I started a strict diet plan given by a very famous dietitian for 3 weeks. He asked to come back in 3 weeks. So, I followed it perfectly, even through a terrible flu that lasted the first 2 weeks. Sandwich for breakfast, steamed veggies & rice for lunch and supplement for dinner. He didn’t ask to do any workouts and I didn’t do any workouts too because I was exhausted by flu, but I stayed on the diet faithfully and lost 3kg in 3 weeks.

During the 3 weeks, I had 2 nights out for drinks (without heavy meals just chicken as snacks) and one cheat breakfast/lunch, which I thought was reasonable. Today, when I went to see him, he shouted at me and said I had no dedication and told me to “come back in one year, when you have no parties or other commitments” before we’d start again. Then he started to give some normal meal plan, “so you can eat snacks and pulses etc, eat a normal diet” and so and so. While I was trying very hard not to burst in to tears, I asked I’m planning to start gym sessions in few days are there any specific plan I should follow? Then he sarcastically said that in my case I’d need to “run at least 10 km daily or lift 80 kg to lose weight.” I didn’t even get a chance to explain I was sick.

I cried a lot after leaving (and trust me I’m not a crying person). I feel like I did everything I could under the circumstances, and the fact that he dismissed my efforts just because of two-three meals out feels… incredibly harsh and unfair. I’ve been sick, tired, and recovering while still sticking to his plan, and yet I was treated like a failure.

My friends and my husband told me the doctor was being idiotic, but I’m still haunted by the experience. Imagine saying something like this to anyone struggling with weight — it’s humiliating and could easily crush someone’s confidence. I just feel like no matter how much effort I put in, it can be invalidated by someone’s ego.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of shaming from a healthcare professional? How did you handle it and move on without letting it mess with your confidence or progress?",66,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oknqv4/followed_a_strict_3week_diet_plan_and_my_doctor/,1761893902.0
1oklnbt,Don't do the HND and Degree programs in Nebula Institute Of technology,post,"# Honest Review: SLT Mobitel Nebula Institute of Technology (HND in EEE & UH Program)

I want to share my honest experience regarding the **HND in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** and the **UH top-up program** offered at Nebula Institute of Technology (affiliated with SLT Mobitel).

In my opinion, this program does **not provide real educational or practical value** for students who wish to build a strong career as an engineer. Here’s why:

* The **HND program mainly focuses on assignments** instead of proper examinations or practical-based evaluations. In today’s context, many assignments can easily be completed using AI tools like ChatGPT, so there’s little genuine learning or assessment happening.
* The **UH top-up program** structure is different from the one offered by SLIIT. The modules are outdated, and there’s **no real technical or industry-relevant content** being added at advanced levels.
* After completing these programs, **graduates are not recognized as engineers** for professional positions or registration purposes in Sri Lanka.
* The **training provided through Telecom Sri Lanka** is very limited and doesn’t add much professional exposure or skill development.
* The **management seems more focused on financial gain** than improving educational quality or providing genuine student support.
* Even the **Cybersecurity and Digital Technology programs** seem poorly structured, with students lacking basic understanding of their subjects.

If you are planning to pursue an **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** related degree, I strongly recommend looking into **CINEC**, **SLIIT International**,SLTC  or other recognized universities.  
These institutions provide **updated modules**, **industry relevance**, and **better academic standards**.

Overall, based on my personal experience, I do **not recommend** doing the HND or UH programs in EEE at Nebula Institute of Technology.",86,https://i.redd.it/mq9a1bwvmdyf1.jpeg,1761885933.0

So lately I've noticed many times uber tuk drivers cancelling the ride midway without checking when the payment is on card.

No checking whether you have cash at hand. You've already gotten in. Ride is midway already almost near to the destination.

Suddenly your app won't show the ride anymore cus the driver has cancelled it.

This has happened to me several times now.

Upgraded from cash or card before beginning the ride to cancelling the ride midway without proper notice. 

So be aware and be careful for your own sake. 


( As a suggestion, Uber should implement a method where the Uber drivers aren't able to cancel a ride once it's verified and trip started until it reaches destination  OR 

if there's any requirement to do so, It should be done with both parties agreeing through the app it self )",32,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1okmrzh/uber_midway_cancellations_by_drivers/,1761890053.0

Below are some of the reasons why I believe I have ADHD.

1. At work, most of the managers I worked with had to repeat the same thing again and again. They also told me that I can’t work independently and make decisions by myself. As a result, I got fired in my last job and almost got fired in two other jobs.

2. My family members repeatedly tell me that I can’t think and do something. Sometimes they question whether I have common sense. It’s mostly similar to what my managers said above.

3. Failure to follow simple instructions/Forgetfulness - For example if my wife tells me to use her credit card for groceries, I’d use the debit card. It happened multiple times, not just once or twice.

4. Lack of clarity about the future - My career is all over the place. Did a bit of finance and then moved to IT. Currently I’m unemployed and even dunno what I’m capable of or good at. I lack confidence 

5. Attention issue - I have a difficulty in paying attention, be it at studies, work or even to what a close family member tells. I think this is the root cause of forgetting, having to repeat the same thing etc.

These are the reasons on top of my head. I seriously feel there’s something wrong with me.

1ojckst,Awareness Post for females— A Disturbing Experience Worth Sharing,post,"(refined all wordings  using chatgpt but true experience I heard today)

During a casual conversation, a young woman shared an incident that had happened around 7–8 years ago — something deeply unsettling.

At that time, she had joined a driving school in her hometown to learn driving. During one of her lessons, the instructor had taken her along a quiet, isolated road with no one nearby. While she was driving, he had dropped a pill into a bottle of water, shaken it for a while, and asked her to drink it, saying it was good for her health.

She had refused, but he had continued to insist. He had then started asking personal questions — whether she had a boyfriend, where she lived — and even told her to prove it. Feeling scared and trapped, she had shown him a photo of a strong-looking guy from her neighborhood just to make him stop.

After that incident, the instructor had become cold and strict with her during the rest of the lessons. She had not told her parents immediately because she did not want them to worry, but she had shared it with them after completing the course.

What was alarming was that the same driving school still exists, showing only two 5-star reviews on Google, both from male profiles with no written comments.

This serves as a strong reminder that safety should never be judged by ratings alone.
 It is always better to research thoroughly, read detailed reviews, and avoid being alone with instructors during the first few sessions.

Her refusal to drink from that bottle might have saved her from something terrible. Trusting your instincts can truly make a difference. ⚠️

EDIT:

After a few requests,
Thissera Driving School - ratnapura.
Regretfully the Instructors name wasn't disclosed neither an image available when searched.

Hope it would really help someone to choose driving schools with better safety and verification.

Usually in the beginning of driving lessons instructors anyhow teach in less traffic roads but better safe than sorry!.

1ojmggi,Anyone know a faster/alternative way to get a degree in SL?,post,"Hi all,

After my OLs I couldn’t continue studying because of my financial situation, so I had to start working right away. I’ve basically been moving from job to job ever since.

Now I’m almost 30, working two jobs and married.

Recently I’ve noticed that in most places I apply, they don’t really consider my application even though I have solid work experience, most likely because I don’t have a degree.

So now I’m thinking of doing a degree just for the sake of doing. But the issue is, with two jobs I don’t have time to fully sit and study, and I also can’t wait 3–4 years for the degree,

1oja4f1,"Seriously, is it just me or is dating getting completely transactional?",post,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I just needed to vent and see if anyone else is dealing with this. It feels like every other story you hear or experience you have is confirming this frustrating pattern.

It really breaks down into two main issues that just drain you.

First, you have the girls who are clearly just dating for the **money**. I get that everyone wants stability, but it’s a whole different thing when you realize you’re being treated less like a partner and more like a walking expense account. The interest is high when the dinners are expensive and the gifts are flowing, but the moment there’s any kind of financial hiccup or suggestion of something less lavish, the dynamic changes instantly. It makes you wonder if they’re even attracted to *you* or just the lifestyle you provide. It’s exhausting to feel like your net worth is your main contribution to the relationship.

The second part is the sheer amount of **emotional playing**. It’s the girls who just seem to be in it for a temporary ego boost or to fill time. They’ll string you along, talk about the future, make you feel like things are real, and then just *poof*—they’re gone. They leave you completely confused and genuinely heartbroken, and they seem totally unaffected by the wreckage they left behind. It’s like a game to them, and they don’t register that they’re dealing with real people with real feelings.

It makes trying to find a genuine, deep connection feel nearly impossible. How are you supposed to vet people when they are so good at pretending? Is true, mutual interest and respect just some fairy tale now, or is it still out there?

What are your stories? How do you guys manage to spot the difference between someone genuinely interested in you and someone who’s just using you for a comfort or a temporary lift?",59,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oja4f1/seriously_is_it_just_me_or_is_dating_getting/,1761757363.0

1oixism,Not becoming a doctor in this country might honestly be a blessing in disguise,post,"I mean no disrespect to anyone in medicine; it’s a noble path, but people really underestimate just how stupid  it is. You spend about 5 years buried in textbooks, and just when you think you’re done, you start your internship. That’s when reality hits. You’re suddenly working 24-hour shifts, barely sleeping, handling endless patients. By the end of the first month you’re drained, by three months you’re basically a zombie in a lab coat.

Then comes the post-intern phase, which can last another 2–4 years. You don’t even get to pick where you go; your posting depends on your rank. So you might end up in some far-off hospital, hoping there’s clean water and no wildlife in the area. The system grinds you down completely; physically, mentally, emotionally. All in the name of “respect”.

And the worst part? You can’t even complain. The moment you do, people say things like, *“Well, no one forced you to become a doctor.”* As if that somehow justifies how badly the system treats you.

When I was small, I used to wonder why doctors always seemed pissed off at everything;  short-tempered, distant, tired. Now that I’ve grown up, I completely get it. After going through what they go through, it would be strange **not** to be angry.

So yeah, if you’re in another field, you might not realize it yet, but you’ve probably dodged a bullet. You may not have a fancy title, but at least you’ll have time, peace, and sanity; and in this country, that’s worth a lot more.

BTW, everything in this post is completely true, not a single part has been exaggerated; wildlife, drinking water, 24 hr shifts, everything. If you get the chance, speak to a doctor thats recently graduated and ask them how proud they are of their life decisions.

 **Edit: I’m not a doctor. I just listened better than the people who are. Which is probably why they’re still suffering while I’m the one describing it better than they can.**",249,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oixism/not_becoming_a_doctor_in_this_country_might/,1761720467.0

I’m landing in Colombo (BIA) around 8:30 AM and plan to head straight to Wilpattu National Park. I’d like to take public transport (bus or train) rather than hire a private car if possible.

Does anyone know the best route or combination of buses/trains to get there? Ideally something reasonably comfortable and not too complicated.

From what I’ve gathered so far:

* The park is near Nochchiyagama or Anuradhapura, so maybe I can get a bus/train there first?
* Are there direct buses from Colombo to those towns, and how frequent are they?
* If I take the train, should I go to Anuradhapura and then take a local bus/tuk-tuk to Wilpattu?

But recently they have increased the charges for other bank transfers and also started to charge a fee for inter bank transfers (for current account). Which is not acceptable as the other banks do not charge for interbank transfers.

However the most recent incident is that one of my cheque got returned and i have not received a call or a email informing the issue, until i call the bank my self to find out. It was just a simple error in date. Have to call the branch and the head office and the branch again to get a picture of the cheque.

I don’t see a reason of paying extra charges when they cannot provide an adequate service to protect our funds. What should i do and what is the best bank to maintain a current account in Sri Lanka.

Ps: this check return will definitely gonna appear on my crib and it’s the first time for me.

1ohvr57,What do SL men actually think about feminism?,post,"

So I was scrolling through Reddit and saw this post where a dude said he refuses to give his kids both his and his wife’s last name cause Im the provider.. so they take my name. 💀 Bro...what century are we in?

Like okay, I get tradition ...... last names and all that..... but itz wild how people still see that as a symbol of dominance or ownership. The whole .....I provide so I own........mentality just screams patriarchy in surround sound.

And heres the thing ......feminism isnt about hating men or thinking women are better. Its literally just about choice. A woman should be able to be whatever she wants ...a housewife.... a CEO....a mechanic....a researcher.....or none of the above...... because she chooses it...not because society boxed her into a.....role.

But ngl....Ive met quite a few Sri Lankan guys who have this completely twisted idea of feminism. Like.. they hear the word and immediately go ...ugh....feminist = man hater.. No bro.... we re just tired of double standards...

So yeah... Im curious..... what do SL men actually think about feminism????
Do you see it as something necessary or something threatening????
And if you re against it.....why exactly???? Genuinely asking....... not trying to start a war here.


EDIT: Thanks for all the honest replies. I’ve gotta say, there really are good guys out there who believe in equality and mutual respect .... the ones who don’t feel the need to control women but just think everyone should be recognized for their skills, not their gender. That’s the energy we need more of.

And to the women reading this, do your thing. Whatever path you choose, own it. Sri Lanka’s still got a long way to go but honestly, we’re not completely trapped in those old school boxes anymore.
If you’re stuck somewhere toxic, please leave. Do whatever you have to do to build the life you want ....you only get one shot at it.

Also, this goes both ways. Some women treat men like competition and that’s not it either. At the end of the day, it’s not a battle of who’s better .... feminism isn’t about hating men, it’s about everyone getting treated equally.

And as for the dudes still stuck in the ""I’m the leader, women obey"" era ..... seriously, educate yourselves. The world’s moving on without you. Don’t let your kids grow up thinking their dad’s mindset expired in 2025.

Also yeah, I realized I use way too many full stops ....sorry, my period key’s been working overtime lately 😅",95,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ohvr57/what_do_sl_men_actually_think_about_feminism/,1761612253.0

I recently completed my A/Ls and have been selected for university, where I’ll be studying Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering.

It’s not that I have zero knowledge about the field, I’ve gained some basic understanding of the job flow through my own research and observations. However, I strongly believe that true insight comes from those with real experience. That’s why I’m reaching out to professionals already working in this industry for guidance and advice. I only have a few questions..

First, How does one progress through the ranks of the four marine engineer positions (4th, 3rd, 2nd, and Chief Engineer)? How long does it typically take to climb to the top, and what are the approximate salary ranges for each stage? 

Second, What can a newcomer or trainee expect to earn at the entry level?

Third, Are there on-shore jobs in this field that offer a similar wage range to sea-based roles?

It'll be silly of me to ask whether this field is challenging, given the demanding nature of sea life and the workload on large commercial vessels, so there won’t be a fourth.

It scans the official CSE announcements and filters only the **cash dividend-related** ones, with record dates, XD dates, and payment details all in one clean table.

No ads, no logins, just quick info for investors.

I wanted to plan a surprise trip to Sri Lanka for my husband. We two will be traveling from Bengaluru to Colombo.

D1 : fly to colombo from blr , reach early morning, take a train to kandy. Stay overnight. 
D2: Sightseeing in Kandy , stay in Kandy

D3: Train to Ella , Sightseeing in Ella, stay in Ella
D4: Train to Eliya, Sightseeing in Eliya, stay in Eliya
D5: Train to Colombo Fort, stay in a beach resort for 2 days
days
D7: back to BLR by flight


I wanted to know if :
 1: Which month is more suitable? I thought to go in Dec but now I will have to reschedule.  Which months are best?- Costwise and Weatherwise.
 2: I want not so hectic and little relaxed kind of trip . So do you guys think I should increase a day in Eliya? Or instead consider Sigiriya?
3: will Train be feasible? I know it might eat up time but I have read it's beautiful and scenic while going on Train journey.
4: any pointers on where we should visit or enjoy local food.?
5:What documents we need to carry with us?

2. Email your branch with:

- Account details (name & number)
- New mobile number or email for OTP
- Reason for update

3. Complete the forms they send you and submit:

- Completed & signed forms
- Email indemnity form (if using email for OTP)
- Copy of visa

1ohozs6,Is Dhammika Perera monopolizing and manipulating capital market of Sri Lanka?,post,"Guys what the hell is going on with Dhammika Perera these days. There are so many news about him buying and selling off shares. Perhaps it seems most of them are direct towards a single goal which is unclear to the general public.

These actions are mostly taken in banking sector whereas he sold off shares of Commercial bank and Seylan bank. Now his key bankers are Sampath Bank and Pan Asia bank.

Again there's a news ongoing about, buying shares of Harischandra Mills and expanding Hayleys to the Super Market sector. Hayleys coming to the retail sector is a major transformation though seems bit off hence they mostly deal with wholesale B2B sectors. This might be a set back for Keells and Cargills because of their dependency of Hayleys products.

No offence... but where ever Dhammika Perera is, the quality of services and goods produced by that business goes down due to his profit seeking mind set (according to my personal experience.)

Does any ISP in Sri Lanka, either residential or business, actually provide a formal uptime guarantee or Service Level Agreement (SLA) that clearly defines something like “99.x% availability”?

Also, does anyone have a reliable contact at SLT who genuinely handles customer service issues?

Calling 1212 is pointless, the support is completely passive and unhelpful. There is no escalation point

Even the branch manager doesn’t apologize or take ownership when things go wrong.

1ohq6qd,Is charitha attalage's New Music Video Yogeshwari Borrowing Twenty One Pilots’ Puzzle-Style Rollout?,post,"Hey everyone — I’m curious to get your thoughts on this:

You know how Twenty One Pilots build these whole teaser/puzzle-universes around their album releases? For example:

Ahead of their album Trench (2018) they dropped cryptic URLs, billboards, visuals tied to their world of “Dema”, characters like Clancy, etc. 

Their album Clancy (2024) also came with a visual album, hints via social posts and what was described as “each song has an accompanying music video” and a narrative arc. 

On their latest album Breach (2025) they again leaned into this: announcing with “cryptic clues and Easter eggs” leading up to the release. 


So: They pretty much invented a kind of “interactive mystery/universe” around their music drops — involving fans decoding, researching, digging into hidden details.

My question to the community:
I’ve just watched charitha attalage ’s new music video and I got strong vibes that it might be closely mirroring the method of Twenty One Pilots i.e., the visuals, teaser-style cryptic imagery, maybe even narrative worldbuilding. On one hand: I like the artistry. On the other: is it just a homage, or is it so close that it feels like a copy?

Has anyone else noticed this resemblance (to TØP’s style)?

Do you think charitha attalage is consciously borrowing from Twenty One Pilots, or is it coincidental / part of broader trends in music video storytelling?

If you’re familiar with Twenty One Pilots’ puzzle/teaser approach, which parts stand out most (for comparison) in charitha’s video?

Finally: is this kind of strategy (teaser-universe + hidden clues) good for the music-video medium? Or does it risk being derivative if too many people copy it?

Would love to hear your takes.

The office was located inside the investor company’s premises, and I received my salary directly from that investor into my bank account for four months.

In September, my boss sent a foreign person to supervise the work. At the end of that month, I was informed that my boss no longer required my services so basically, I was terminated.

The termination itself is not an issue for me. I don’t wish to work with them again after this dispute. My only concern is that I haven’t received my salary for September, even though I worked the full month.

When I contacted my boss (who’s in the UK), he refused to respond. When I asked the investor company, they said the boss told them not to pay my final month’s salary, so they won’t release it.

I gave my full effort and completed all my work properly. Now I’m stuck because the company isn’t officially registered, and both the boss and the investor are refusing to pay me.

Places like X, IG, and even a lot of Reddit forums are becoming a shitshow with regards to very open racism. Ironically some Sri Lankans support it, not understanding that a racist wouldn't know how to separate a Sri Lankan in the first place nor would they care even if they could!

Would see yourself raising your kids there where they *could* be perpetual ""outsiders"" in the eyes of some (definitely not all of course) ? Or would you seriously consider moving back (while possibly keeping both citizenships) after earning decent money that you could use to invest or support yourself to lead a ""comfortable life"" in SL?

Regardless the pros and cons of giving child a phone, Do you think the government has the right to manipulate our daily life? This is more like CCP giving  their citizen orders about how to live. I bet SL will go from democratic republic to communist republic in some more days. Anyway lets hope for the best!

**EDIT**\- For the people who says this is an good idea... yes it may be, then children might have time to touch some grass and connect with the nature. But completely alienating the child from technology is too much. If your child consuming too much brain rot videos its their parents responsibility to control what the child see (that's why **parental controls** exist) not the government. The government itself says that they should be advanced by technology, but how you should expect that when your future generations don't see any inspiration from technological aspect.

The whole negative thing started with the wrong use of parents, of mobile phones on their child without proper supervision  
example- ""Lamayata bat tika kawanna lesi phone eka athata dunnama""  
Anyway in such times also its parents responsibility to make your child see proper content which can help to to stimulate their thirst for knowledge

Please note that I'm a 22 year old and have no experience in having a child. This is all what I conceive from my day today experience, Hence I may be wrong in some aspects",93,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ogpe4q/govt_plans_mobile_phone_ban_for_children_below_12/,1761497118.0
1oh8pfd,Need advice from my Sri Lankan bros about buying a Yamaha MT-15 V2 (Brand New) / (A trustworthy dealer),post,"Hey guys 👋

I’m planning to buy a **Yamaha MT-15 V2 (2025)** brand new.  
I’ve been checking with a few places and most of them said the **price is around 1.5 million**. They ask for 50,000 LKR for the preorder and another 450,000 LKR once the bike arrives, so about 500,000 LKR down payment in total. Then, it’s around 30,000 LKR per month for 5 years.

My problem is, I’m struggling to find a **genuine place** to buy from here in Sri Lanka.  
So if anyone here has experience or knows a **trustworthy dealer**, please drop your recommendations  
it would mean a lot 🙏

A bit about me I'm 23M and I’m from Colombo 12 and I work in Townhall, so my daily travel is just about 2.5 km each way. On weekends, I go to Dehiwala for my university classes. I don’t really go on long rides, it’s mostly short daily travel. (My knowledge about bikes is kinda poor)

**I used to own a Pulsar 135 (second-hand)** before, but **that bike was always in the garage**. It gave me more problems than peace, and honestly, that experience made me **hate bikes for a long time** 😅

But this time, I’ve been **saving up for a long time** because I want **something New, reliable and long-lasting**. So this is a **big decision** for me.

Would really **appreciate some honest advice** from anyone who’s familiar with the MT-15 or with buying brand new bikes in Sri Lanka. 🙏  
Thanks a lot in advance, my Sri Lankan bros ❤️

My girlfriend and I will visit Sri Lanka from the 8th until the 28th of November. We are trying to make a conceptual travel plan, but like to stay flexible. I was hoping you guys would like to help me out with some things.

\- At first we figured we would start at Colombo for 2 days. However, online we noticed a lot of people advice Negombo. Can anyone tell me what the pros and cons are of both? Are plan is to travel to central Sri Lanka and then move to south and travel back around the coast while we relax and surf.

\- We are looking to travel from Colombo/Negombo to Sigiriya → Kandy → Ella → Udawalawe → Tangalle → Mirissa → Colombo/Negombo. Are we missing any amazing places with this route or are there any amazing places close to one of those above that we should definitely pay a visit? We love nature, animals and locals the most. We don't enjoy temples and statues as much and we are not looking for nightlife (party, etc.).

\- Also, are there places you'd recommend staying just 2 nights or maybe longer and if so, can you explain why?

\- We want to visit a National Park and ChatGPT advised us to go to Udawalawe National Park since it's close to our travel route, not too busy and good during november. Are second option would be Wilpattu National Park. We love to see wild animals but we've seen elephants already so preferably bears, crocodiles, leopards, monkeys and such. We love birds too, but it's not a gamechanger for us. Are we good with the Udawalawe National Park?

\- We would also like to follow a cooking class. Any recommendations where and maybe even with which provider? Any other activity we should really do that I haven't mentioned?

\- We plan on doing a train ride as well. From Kandy to Ella seems to be the most famous one. Does it matter that much and if not, what other parts can you recommend?

\- We also plan on renting a TukTuk for a big part of our travel. Since apparantly from Colombo/Negombo to Sigiriya is quite far we might do it after our train ride and travel with the TukTuk back across the coast to Colombo/Negombo. We are travelling with 2 suitcases though, not backpacks. Is there enough room for two suitcases in the back or is a TukTuk a no-go for us?

\- Lastly, do you have any tips and tricks we should do or know about or things we should definitely avoid?

Thanks in advance for the time you took to read my post and maybe even reply. I appreciate your comments. I've Googled most of it (or asked ChatGPT), but I feel like you, the Sri Lankan people, or the active Sri Lanka travelers, know best. Have a good day!

1ogpmqs,ISP rant (hutch cliq packages),post,"
As we all know, the Hutch Cliq packages are some of the best bang-for-your-buck cellular internet options in Sri Lanka, with the 30-day, 60GB FUP plan being the most popular. I've used Cliq since it was under Etisalat, and it has been a reliable package with decent speeds.

When Hutch first introduced it with new 4G speeds, the service was consistently good throughout the day. Download speeds were decent enough until the FUP kicked in, and I had no complaints. Peak hours were slow, but that was always to be expected.

Lately, however, I can't help but think the package has become nearly unusable for anything beyond basic browsing—even with good signal strength. At my house, I get the full Cliq speed of 20Mbps (the cap for these packages) at all times except during peak hours, when it drops to around 3-10Mbps. For comparison, non-Cliq speeds on the same network reach up to 60Mbps during off-peak hours and 35Mbps during peak hours, which is amazing.

But the real-world experience, before hitting the FUP, tells a different story:

· YouTube constantly buffers, even at 360p/480p at times.
· Downloads are always capped at 200-300 KB/s, despite full signal and speed tests showing 20Mbps. I only get the full speeds (around 2 MB/s) between 12-7 AM. Torrents are even worse, at 100-200 KB/s.
· Video conferencing lags, stutters, and buffers.
· Streaming anything is a buffering hell from start to finish. 1080p is only possible during the off-peak hours mentioned, with Netflix being the sole exception.

Let's say we could manage all that; the absolute worst part, however, is the connectivity. I feel like ever since the day Hutch had that island-wide outage, the connectivity has been really poor, with CONSTANT disconnections every 3-5 minutes. You end up having to toggle airplane mode or switch mobile data on and off to restore decent speeds or connectivity. I've tested this on multiple phones, and the connectivity issues persist.

The result is that conferences get cut off or become laggy and blurry, you can't watch a video or stream in peace, downloads get corrupted or are suddenly throttled mid-download, and gaming suffers from extreme latency paired with these disconnections. Basically, the only thing this package is good for right now is browsing—and even social media buffers.

Everyone in my family uses Cliq separately, but I've been thinking of switching to the Fiber Flash 10 unlimited package, which will undoubtedly be better while still fitting my budget.

1ogpow0,Salaries in Corporate Sri Lanka and Climbing the Ladder,post,"Out of all the A/L Streams, Commerce has one of the largest student bases and even Government and Private Universities have lots of students studying Business Management, Accounting and Finance related degrees.

As a high schooler with zero real world experience I was wondering how does one go about starting a corporate career? What degrees and qualifications would be best to study? How is the competition in the Job Market? Should you diversify by learning different fields like Tech and Law too? How do you acquire skills to start your own side hustle?

What kind of companies and industries should you target for? How do you make connections and get a good name within your company and get promotions to climb the ladder? What is company culture and does drama brew between colleagues everyday or in events?

Do people usually change jobs every 3-5 years to get a salary bump? How do you earn the Big Bucks?

Also what kind of skills and experience along with qualifications do you need to be employable abroad incase you need to make a move? Is there anything I missed or need to know?

1ogmsur,Education and infrastructure for the estate sector,post,"Guys has anyone noticed how despite the cities progressing at a rapid state, outside cities are basically 20 years in the past?

Their schools are very basic if nothing at all, some places don’t have access to electricity, no bus stop. The majority of people there drop out after O-levels to work somewhere or run a tuk. 

This is especially true for the central estate sector, for a group that pretty much carries the country on their back with tea and various other exports they’re basically treated like cattle. 

They live in line rooms (you need to see a line room in person to understand how bad it is) and each school is several kilometers from home with freezing weather and rain, most don’t do their A-levels, males start working at the estate after O-levels and females either get married early or start estate or tea plucking work early, they have children and the same cycle continues. 

Some of them don’t even have NIC cards or identity documents 

But if you look at the estate owners and managers they’re rich to the point it’s like royalty and peasants. The city municipal councils there have some of the largest budgets you can imagine. 

Despite every govt including the current one promising change it’s usually a maximum of a daily wage increase and that’s it. This govt has representation from the estate sector also. 

At some point estate workers invited the govt MPs or president to come tour their living conditions, see their line rooms etc but so far no one’s cared enough to make significant change.

But the second object, the one that looked like a rocket or missile coming from the southwest and disappearing toward the northeast, still remains a mystery. I searched multiple live rocket launch trackers, yet found no scheduled launches that match the timing or trajectory.

Captured both, one ordinary, one extraordinary.

Moments like these remind me how much is still happening above and around us that we don't always understand.

If anyone has insights into unscheduled launches, test flights, or re-entry events visible from Sri Lanka around 6:58-7:05 AM today, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

1oggk1h,CIMA vs MBA for a Cybersecurity Graduate Working in DevOps (Looking to Move Toward Management & Consulting),post,"Hey everyone 👋

I graduated last month with a degree in Cybersecurity, and I’m currently working full time remotely for a foreign company in the DevOps field. The pay is decent, so money isn’t really the issue, my main focus right now is moving up the career ladder and preparing for the future.

Here’s a bit of background:
After my A-Levels, I actually started CIMA because I’ve always had an interest in the business side of things. I only completed the Certificate Level, then started my degree.

Now that I’m working full-time, I’m trying to decide whether I should continue CIMA or instead go for an MBA. My long-term goal is to move into consulting, project management, and IT-business management roles, not just stay on the purely technical side.

I also have some business ideas that I plan to work on in the near future, so gaining solid business and management knowledge would really help.

So my question is:
1. Would it be better to complete CIMA fully or go for an MBA?
2. Or are there any other professional or practical qualifications that would add more value to my skills and goals?

For context, I plan to move abroad in about 2–3 years, so I want to build a good foundation before that.

Would love to hear your thoughts and recommendations 🙏

* 🧠 I’m also genuinely interested in **people and psychology** — understanding behavior, motivation, etc.
* 👨‍🏫 I enjoy teaching and would love to **become a part-time lecturer** someday.
* 💻 On the tech side, I’m planning to complete my **Microsoft Power Platform certifications (PL-900, PL-100, PL-400, etc.)**.

I’m trying to figure out:

1. What would be the best **study path or postgraduate options** (MBA, MSc, or something else)?
2. How can I **combine my interests** in business, psychology, and tech effectively?
3. What would be a **realistic career roadmap** for the next 3–5 years (considering I’m from Sri Lanka and starting my career)?
4. Any tips for moving into **teaching or lecturing** while staying in the software field?

Would really appreciate hearing from anyone who’s taken a similar route — whether you transitioned from tech to business, became a lecturer, or built your own company.

I'll be visiting early Sri Lanka in early November, and based on what I've read, South and West coast are good spots to be doing scuba diving and snorkeling.

1ogdomi,Is it fine to buy non-genuine Japanese parts for cars ?,post,"I wanted to replace some parts for my Toyota such as the water pump, brake pads and few others.

I also see adverts by toyota saying not to buy these non genuine parts as it may be risk and not durable. 

I want to know if its worthwhile to go for the genuine parts by Toyota Lanka, or even these non genuine good parts from Japan is still fine. Should I be concerned about the risk and is the durability less?

I started doing a course at VTA and it didn't go well. Anyways I completed it (1 year draughtsman course) and somehow I Started doing A'Ls again in the middle of 2023.
I did maths with ICT for 2024 A'L and now I have the oopportunity to follow this MIT course in uok.

I am not sure what to do anymore. I was interested in software engineering at some point but that interest is gone now. Also I find that working in IT is too stressful for me.(But I can handle it if I have to.)  Kinda feel like I wanna switch to another field but it seems hard now.
In other hand, my parents are too old, I have to take the responsibility of the family (I am the only boy in familly)

What to do now?
Is it possible to find a good job and earn first, then follow an external part time degree while working so I can manage the expenses.. Should I follow that MIT degree at anycost?
Doing part time jobs while following the MIT course would be a solution ?
Or how can I switch field?
I am also interested in business,accounting..

Any advice is appreciated. :)

Also I am grateful If there is any job opportunity too. Sorry If I am asking for too much but, If you are a business owner , Is there any chance that I can work and learn under your guidance ?

I recently saw a few posts and discussions asking whether Sri Lanka actually has oil and gas reserves. I stumbled upon this U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Fact Sheet (2025-3043) published in 2024, and thought it might be useful to share here.

The report estimates about 1 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable conventional oil and over 53 trillion cubic feet of gas in the India + Sri Lanka region, mainly covering the Mannar and Cauvery Basins.

It doesn’t mean we already have commercially viable reserves - but it does show there’s recognized potential under our offshore territory.

Honestly, if Sri Lanka ever develops recoverable oil or gas, I hope we follow the Norwegian model and build something like a sovereign wealth fund to invest in long-term national development - rather than turning it into short-term subsidies or populist giveaways.

I’ll be basing myself around **Weligama/Ahangama**, with short hops to **Hikkaduwa** and **Mirissa for NYE**. I’m a laid-back, social traveller (think: scooters, sunsets, small beach bars, hostel meetups—not into super-club/EDM nights).

**About me / vibe**

* UK-based, here to meet new people, make new friends and create amazing memories!
* **Advanced Open Water** diver — keen on a relaxed **2-tank day** around **Unawatuna/Galle (Orestes/Rangoon?)** or **Hikkaduwa** reefs.
* Daytime goals: **Galle Fort** wander, **Handunugoda tea estate**, **Coconut Tree Hill / Secret Beach**, maybe **Kanneliya/Sinharaja** for a rainforest fix, **Dondra Lighthouse**, and a mellow **sunset bar** run.
* Evenings: hostel socials, open-mics/rooftops, low-key beach bars.

**Draft plan (flexible):**

* **Dec 21–23:** Weligama (likely **Spindrift** / **Hangtime**) to meet people.
* **Dec 23–25:** Hikkaduwa for a change of scene (Narigama area).
* **Dec 26–29:** Back around Weligama/Ahangama (scooter loops, maybe Doctor’s House one evening).
* **Dec 30–Jan 2:** **Mirissa** for a chilled **NYE on the beach** (small venue/wristband over big clubs).
* **Jan 3:** Back to CMB.

**Looking for:**

* Recommendations for **social hostels** (dorm *or* private) where you’ve actually met people.
* Pointers to **active WhatsApp/Telegram meetups** in Weligama/Ahangama/Mirissa (volleyball, open-mics, scooter convoys, dive buddy groups).

1oep5u4,I hate beggars who keep coming to our house,post,"I'll probably get downvoted but I'm so fed up and frustrated with beggars who come to our house and knock or bang on our gate. It's extremely annoying. Most of them are perfectly capable of working for a living but they choose to beg instead. Disabled or homeless people have an excuse but there's men in their 40s or 30s begging too. The majority are women below the age of 50. All these people have perfectly functioning hands, legs etc and they have homes, even if they are slums. Like wtf, get a job? 

I say this because there's a really old woman that my mom got as a maid from a neighbor and she looks so old and frail but works so hard and for the whole day. Apparently she charges only 1000 for a day's work but that's obviously slave labor and I told my mom to give her at least 2k and food which is still not enough in my opinion. And there's many others who are old but have been working their whole life and earn their money respectfully. So it boils my blood to see perfectly healthy people choosing to be lazy and beg.  

I have a policy where I won't give money to anyone for free but if they do some work I would tip them or pay extra. Like delivery riders, waiters or others in the service industry. Freeloaders should not be rewarded.",262,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oep5u4/i_hate_beggars_who_keep_coming_to_our_house/,1761282449.0

1of7gt3,Sri Lanka sitting on billion Dollors $ of mineral mining proposals,post,"Sri Lanka sitting on billion dollars of mineral mining proposals 

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment has seen strong investor interest in mineral mining with 14 proposals worth billion dollars coming into the agency, Chairman Arjuna Herath said.

Investors were awaiting a policy framework from the government.

“So, that policy formulation is happening at this moment,” Herath said. “Minerals would be another sector and industry that really will drive our investments in the country and, economic development in this country.”

Sri Lanka is seeing investor inquiries and stronger interest from foreign investors as the country recovers from default and they see political and economic stability, he said.

Sri Lanka has mineral sands which are now exported in raw and various graded forms with royalties at the exported prices and some complex value addition requirements.

Sri Lanka mineral industry kept down by unusual export value added tax

Australia keen to invest in Sri Lanka phosphate, graphite, ilmenite sectors: High Commissioner

Local mining firms have said in the past the royalties are far higher than countries like Australia and mining licenses are too short term, deterring investors.

Mining licenses in successful countries are given for 10 to 15 years, industry officials have said.

Areas like graphite were among the first minerals that were exported by indigenous entrepreneurs during British rule but they were later expropriated.

Then another 3+ weeks for the handover, another week for the number, and now it’s been over a week waiting for the book. They’re utterly irresponsible. Nobody gives a straight answer about when we’ll actually get it.

They’ve been like this from the very start. We saw all the red flags but still went ahead with the order. Customers are constantly coming in and creating a scene because nobody takes any accountability. I’m honestly baffled that the management hasn’t fixed their operations. It’s shocking that a company can run like this and still survive.

They have *no* customer service whatsoever. No updates, no urgency, no care. I’m beyond frustrated at this point.

It’s honestly ridiculous. Even the managers don’t even answer their phones. Nobody seems to take any responsibility — it’s like they just don’t care. They know we have no choice but to sit and wait while they drag things out at their own pace.

There are so many others in the same situation, all stuck dealing with the same nonsense. Even the guy who handled our case doesn’t care anymore probably because he’s already got his commission. Every day it’s the same story: “It didn’t come,” “It’s not on the list,” It’s exhausting.

There’s absolutely nobody we can push this to. It’s so frustrating that we’re spending all this money and getting treated like this. 

At this point, we’re really done with it. Does anyone have any advice on how we can get this sorted out soon, or know anyone at AMW we can contact?

We’re looking for a place where our little one can really enjoy themselves: ideally somewhere with a kids pool, soft play area, children’s activities, and a social environment with other families around. Basically, a spot that has really considered what young children would love.

We’re open to any part of the island, coastal or inland, as long as it’s safe, comfortable, and has that “kid heaven” vibe. It could be a family resort, a hotel with great kids facilities, or even a family-friendly town where there are play areas and other children to meet.

I wanted to ask those who are working in the IT industry or doing recruitment in Sri Lanka. What kind of CV are companies really expecting these days?

Back in 2024, I applied for Senior Software Engineer roles at 4 companies using a CV that included my photo. I got interview calls from 3 of them and ended up with multiple offers.

This year (2025), I changed my resume to an ATS-friendly format without a photo, just a clean simple layout. But I haven’t received any calls so far, even though I’m applying for similar positions.

So I’m wondering:

* Have most local companies started using ATS systems now?
* Do recruiters here still prefer photo CVs?
* Or am I missing something important with my new format or content?

First phase over 2 years the elimination of bottles. Return to glass with a refund system.  Standardise all bottles into distinct sizes.

Takeaways, return to a system of tiffin boxes or similar. Or one use paper boxes which incur an extra charge.

Supermarkets everyone purchases a one time large cloth bag that they keep and take around when they do their shopping.

Ban single use forks and knives and spoons. This will result in far less waste and a better looking clean environment.

So, could you help me with a few details?

* There are rumors that, after recent incidents, it's no longer legal to obtain a driving license for a three-wheeler, for me, as a foreigner. I tried asking ChatGPT and searched Google, of course. I’m pretty sure that’s nonsense, but I’d like to confirm it.
* What’s the usual price for renting this kind of vehicle for one month? Also, what about the cost of insurance and a local permit? Just approximate numbers — for someone like me, a visitor (and a guest 😉).
* Can you recommend a decent agency that offers this kind of service? I already know the big names, but maybe there’s a hidden gem you could suggest.
* And, last but not least, Is there anything else I should consider that I haven’t mentioned?

1oeulob,Selected as a Software Engineering Intern but no agreement or offer letter should I be concerned?,post,"Hey everyone,

I recently got selected as a **Software Engineering intern** at a startup**.** They asked me to do simple task which I’m excited about it’s a good opportunity to show my skills.

However they **haven’t given me any internship agreement or offer letter yet**. There’s been no mention of duration, stipend, or official confirmation just verbal communication over chat.

Before starting serious work, I’m wondering if this is normal for small startups or if it’s a red flag. I don’t want to seem pushy, but I also don’t want to get into a situation where my work isn’t recognized or I have no proof that I interned there.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Should I wait for an agreement before doing the actual redesign or is it fine to proceed as long as I keep records of my work?

Any advice from people who’ve interned at startups would be really helpful",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oeulob/selected_as_a_software_engineering_intern_but_no/,1761303383.0

I feel like so broke and empty from inside. A few days ago my supervisor got a meeting for all of us and said this “if you really wanna go up in the corporate ladder, you might sell your soul” and it hit me hard. 

Those executives are living for working. They don’t have any other life except their work related things. And they expect the same from us. I enjoy foods, musics but I need money for that. That’s why I’m working. Most of my co-workers doing bullshit. They aren’t actually working and so freaking unproductive. They spent like 2hrs just for the lunch. At 12.30 they go out to grab their lunch and eat until 2pm. And take another 30min for sanitary needs. Im not joking. Because of this unproductiveness we all the team have to do work even after we came home. 

This is the best thing, when I first came there I realized the working environment and the mental health is so good and not like what social media says - because they are working so freely. But couple of weeks after I realized they are actually doing nothing lol. 

Another thing the difference between co-workers and friends. I’m originally from A/pura and I had few good friends. Now I lost them because I don’t meet them regularly and they are doing their A/l for the third time. But I met some good guys in my office - they are good if every other thing good but if some bad happened they are all gone. They are pretending like good but they all are acting. I’m not saying they are wrong maybe that’s the best thing you can do to survive in your workplace. But anyway now I don’t have anyone to do any serious conversation. Kinda sad about that

And I feel like this. These corporate people are brainwashed to work their whole life or they actually can’t escape this cycle. I believe there are more peeps have more experiences than me in this sub. Give me your honest opinion about this. Because I can’t discuss about any of this with my mom and dad, they are getting upset so quickly.

1odvywj,The Sri Lankan Leopard: An Apex Predator with Less Need for a Tree-Pantry,post,"The Sri Lankan leopard is unique because, on its island home, it has evolved to be the apex predator, lacking the intense competition faced by other leopards. This distinction profoundly changes its behavior, especially its use of trees.

Hoisting Kills: A Reduced Necessity

For leopards in Africa, the main reason to struggle with a heavy kill up a tree is to protect it from large, dominant kleptoparasites like lions and hyenas. Since these competitors are absent in Sri Lanka, the urgency to hoist a meal is dramatically reduced.

Unlike their mainland counterparts who hoist most kills, the Sri Lankan leopard rarely hoists prey. This behavioral difference is a direct result of being the island’s supreme predator, eliminating the need to defend a carcass from superior scavengers.

Trees for Rest and Vantage: The Main Purpose

While they may not use trees as a pantry, their arboreal ability is still vital for comfort, safety from ground disturbance, and surveillance. They are muscular, powerful climbers, perfectly adapted to the island’s diverse forests.

The leopard commonly uses tree branches to rest during the heat of the day, offering a cool, safe, and concealed spot. This also provides an excellent vantage point to scan for prey or intruders without revealing their position.

Behavior: Adaptations to Being King

Because the Sri Lankan leopard faces less risk of territorial disputes or having its food stolen, it exhibits subtle behavioral shifts compared to other subspecies:

• Larger Size: With no competitors to restrict their access to prey, Sri Lankan male leopards have evolved into one of the largest subspecies in the world.

• Less Secrecy: Some studies suggest they may be slightly more active during the day (diurnal) than other leopards, likely because they don’t have to strictly avoid larger, nocturnal threats.",36,https://i.redd.it/m2jpjwj22twf1.jpeg,1761200811.0

1odyxyw,Oliveyoung to Sri Lanka 🇱🇰,post,"Hi
This is my personal experience with 1st Oliveyoung order. I completed the purchase on 5th of October and my order was around LKR 18K in order to fulfil the free shipping (>60USD). Parcel was shipped via EMS and arrived in Sri Lanka on 16th of October and somehow ended in Kandy Post office although the address i put was in Kurunegala.  Then I had to go there and clear out the package and I had to pay another 5k for custom clearance 🥴🥴🥴.  The parcel was just a one cardboard box and although I'm not sure about the exact weight, it must be below 1kg. 

Well the thing is 1 month ago I purchased several Japanese cosmetic products from Dokodemo.world,  cost was around 7k , remember this was for products + shipping. The method of shipping was small parcel category through Japanese post, not EMS. That time I was asked to come to Colombo Central mail exchange. My Father went there instead of me and cleared things for me and He had to pay only like LKR 400 for custom clearance.  

Has anyone ordered recently from olive young and experienced the same ?   ",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1odyxyw/oliveyoung_to_sri_lanka/,1761212552.0

1o21unn,"Sri Lanka, a major disappointment",post,"I had commented on how I felt about Sri Lanka on another post, only to be just downvoted and asked to leave the country, but I feel that this could serve as a warning for for coming travelers and maybe as a board of discussion for the locals. 

I just want to start by saying that I have been travelling Asia for 10 years now, and have been living in Asia continously for the last 5 years, i am not new to this and in no way an amateur traveller. I want to point out some of the things that made me positive that I will never come back to this island. 

But first, let me list the good:

The nature: Sri Lanka is very very green! Most of Asia is, but here, the nature feels, for a lack of a better word, compressed, in one tiny area you could have a very large number of trees and plants, it beautiful, and it just feels so jungly without the rough bits but only the pretty ones,there is also plenty of open nature which is also just gorgeous. 

The weather: been here from July till October, and honestly The weather is just lovely, it gets hot sometimes sure, but never the sort of heat like u would face in Vietnam or south India, it's very bareble and almost everywhere I have been ( central and south) the nights are cool and pleasant, except one or two places known for their heat. 


The bad:

Constant harassment: I have travelled Asia, Europe, Africa and the middle east, Sri Lanka is the first country where I actually had to yell at someone. The harassment is relentless, it's nonstop, the tuktuk drivers, the men in the street, the shop owners, it is nonstop that at some point I just wore my headphones to block out the noise and completely stopped responding. 

Unsafe for women: most travelling women I have met had said that they felt very unsafe here if alone, which made sense because I noticed that most travellers here come in two, in my three months here, I think I met a single woman travelling solo from spain, and she herself said that she always went to very secluded beaches so no one would harras her, and even then never felt comfortable wearing her swimsuit. Sri Lankan men are creepy, with an air of very misplaced of confidence which honestly is just gross, never have I felt safe around them. The ""hello! Hello!"" ""Where are you going?"" Is literally nonstop, just constant background noise. 

The dishonesty: everybody smiles, but it is almost immediately followed by asking for money in one form or another, behind the smiles is nothing but grifting. Multiple times I had the booking.com hosts charge me the commission that booking.com charges them, and get very upset when I tell them no. There is this air of ""hustling"" that everyone has that honestly anywhere else would just be seen as straight up scamming. I have ALWAYS been short changed, they somehow never have the right change, until u refuse to pay, and then suddenly they remember the other pocket. Many restaurants I have been to had hidden local menus and then the tourist menu that is about 4 times more expensive than the average price 

Rude and proud: I came to Sri Lanka, because as someone who has studied and practices Buddhism I was hoping Buddhist qualities to be around, all I found was this extreme pride in being ""pure budhists"" while exhibiting not a single trait of it, people are rude, they ignore you midsentence and get offended at anything, and again the constant harrasment and grifting. Even the monks were rude, not all, but most had their air of superiority around them, whole they are supposed to be kind, humble and compassionate. 


All in all this was an experience, I stayed longer because I didn't want to judge from one or two experiences, and I wanted to see for myself if it's different in other places of the country. Sri Lanka has been a major disappointment and I will never be coming back here again, now will I ever advice anyone to come. 

End rant 

Edit: been getting the kind of responses you would expect from such a post, and that's cool, wanted to share my experience, and everyone is allowed to react as they feel is accurate . 

Edit 2: some people have pointed out that the smiling for the sake of grifting bit is not true or exaggerated, if you go to r/digitalnomad u will see a few people complaining about the same thing. Scamming is common anywhere that much is true, but the whole pretending to be your friend or wanting to chat only to try to hook u in is just cheap, I even had one guy convince me that my bus is not coming, and that I should go with him to some other town where I can get another bus ;/ , like really, wtf is that. 

Edit 3: the comments I guess serve my point, you have honest Sri lankans agreeing or half agreeing with me (many made great pro and cons points, which I really appreciate), and then those that talk like I am talking gibberish and must have been in another dimension, and also downvoting the other srilankans because they won't just deny anything bad said about the county, this the pride and easily offended bit that I was talking about. No growth will ever come from this

I'm 21 and I'm doing my third shy for ALs this year 
My goal is to get in to medical faculty, I haven't found myself a purpose other than than tbh, ive always wanted to volunteer as a doctor in refugee camps....it's like a dream of mine 
And let's say I def can't afford to go to a private medschool, I don't want to either. 
I want to go to a gov university, see what uni life in Sri Lanka is yk

Now here's the problem 
I for my first shy I got BCC , B for chemistry 
And for the context, i was a straight A student until I was not, I got severely depressed dying the covid times, doing better now but I'm still not what I was before, 
So I thought I could do well in my sec shy 
And when I did my first shy, I had done past papers atleast 2 times, many many models papers, I had scores abt 55-75 for all subjects 
In sec shy, it was the same, I was pretty sure I'd atleast get 3Bs and at that point I was like , okay I could atleast study bio in uni and later study medicine abroad, with my own money 
But no, I got 3Cs and my parents were devastated so was I. 
I was so ready for the exams, I had good scores but it was like I ruin things durin the exam, I don't even know what I do wrong anymore 

When I got results, i decided to do a third shy, all my friends moved on but I decided to do it again, my dad wanted me to do cima, but I declined it too, I didn't wanna end my AL journey that way 
I studied for the past few months Nd hv pretty average scores, like 50-60 for all subjects, and I think I could up it more during these two months 
But my previous experience of having good scores but still getting Cs keep bothering me, like what if it unfolds the same way this time too? 

I feel like I'm not working hard enough, I could possibly pull off long study hours but recently I've been slacking off, probably because life has been so monotonous for like 5 years 
But I know some ppl hv survived this and I want to too, i want to be more drived and dedicated, I know I can but I feel like I keep sabotaging my own future 

I'd rly rly appreciate any views, advice, encouragement or experience you might have to offer me....

1ossevq,Should I go for a brand-new car with a big lease or stay within my comfort zone?,post,"Hey everyone,

Need some genuine advice here. I’m planning to upgrade my current vehicle and will have around 6 million LKR once I sell it.

Now, my family’s pushing me to go for something brand new around 10 million, like a Fronx or Perodua Ativa, with a 4 million lease. But honestly, I feel like that’ll just drain me — paying off a heavy lease every month isn’t something I want to stress over.

Personally, I’m more comfortable going for something around 6–7 million, maybe a Swift RS (2017) or similar, so that even if I take a small lease, it’s manageable.

So what do you guys think?
Is it worth stretching for a brand-new car and a big lease, or better to stay practical and avoid the financial pressure?

**I honestly find it hard to believe that Sri Lanka will ever change and here are some reasons**

*-* ***TLDR;*** *The main holder for everything I mentioned is --->* ***Our societal standards are lower than that of the average***\*.\*

1. No road discipline, people honk for literally the smallest thing, not something u see anywhere except here in south asia.
2. Food, etc being really unhygeinic, if you compare it to any country that is not south asia, it's really bad
3. People are reluctant to change, will protest for anything that puts them out of their comfort zone
4. We romanticize what's wrong (we make it normal in society), like **ragging** etc.
5. Absolutely no urban planning, Houses appear literally anywhere, roads aren't even planned, nor are neighourhoods.
6. People fighting over different parties in the parliment that lead to no good (I mean we have quite a few opposition leaders etc, idk much honestly regarding this topic)
7. We are literally known for always being late than scheduled, not doing work properly on time, and just not delivering to a certain expectation (government related services etc, literally the opposite of what some countries are known for).
8. We litter our own surroundings like it's second nature to us, people just don't think twice about throwing their wrappers, bottles etc to the ground after using it, I know this isn't everyone but it's still a fair amount
9. We don't have any advanced industries, when it comes to garbage etc, it's all lacking behind, we can't always keep using the war/government as an excuse.
10.  Spitting the betel leaf thing on the road, it's like just so normal now.

To summarise, I think our people are willing to change and adjust to any law etc in other countries but except our own, you can't always blame the government for everything, like streets that are littered, people not willing to work on time or properly etc.

For me, I thought about the multiple different ways our country could honestly be better, and I don't think it will ever happen without a dictatorship or something, atleast a proper one, democracy will get us nowhere, because you will have to satisfy a bunch on uneducated people or else you lose the vote. Idk this is just my view, even if we have a good government, our cities won't look like that of Japan, Malaysia, Singapore etc, I highly doubt it. The main problems we suffer from live deeply rooted within our socities etc. We are so reluctant to change that the people who want to change will just find themselves moving abroad and never coming back.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oso9zm/i_feel_like_sri_lanka_will_never_honestly_change/,1762707170.0

How can this be uncivilized and misdirection? This is what gives them the knowledge on what is right and wrong practices in sex.

Not having proper sex education is why teenagers fall into pornography in the first place.

1osmi3z,"Trivializing Sri Lankan food by calling most savory dishes ""curry"" instead of using individual names",post,"As the title says, people call every dish they eat with a carb as ""curry"". For most people outside south asia, curry is just one specific thing and the whole uniqueness of a dish disappears when you call it as such. For example, I've seen people call ambul thiyal as ""sour fish curry"" or eggplant moju as ""eggplant curry"". There are various cooking styles such as dry toasting (mallung), stir fries (themparadu), dry gravies, or even gravies without the use of any curry powder (such as miris malu or kiri hodi) which all get trivialized into ""curry"". 

I guess people wrongly translate the Sinhala word ""ව්‍යාංජන"" as ""curry"" when a better word would be ""accompaniments"". Now, one could say that there aren't any English names for most Sri Lankan dishes. But, is that really necessary? Nobody uses English names for dishes such as sushi, pad thai, biryani, rendang, pho, and so on. Even when there are ""English"" words, they don't mean much to someone outside Sri Lanka (hoppers or string hoppers are great examples).

1osl6uq,"If you had to choose between your old mother and your future partner, who would you choose depending on your culture SL ?",post,"This question exposes more than emotions. It reveals your entire value system.

If you choose your mother, you are standing by loyalty, gratitude, and moral debt. She gave you life and raised you; you owe her everything. But choosing her also means clinging to the past instead of building your own. Eventually, she will be gone, and if you never built your own foundation, you will be left with regret and emptiness.

If you choose your partner, you are betting on creation, your future, your legacy, and your independence. You will likely face guilt, judgment, and emotional backlash for “abandoning” your mother, but that is the cost of growth and adulthood.

At the core, the choice reflects your stage of life:

If you are still emotionally dependent, you will pick your mother.

If you are ready to lead your own life, you will pick your partner. Not because you love your mom less, but because you honor her by living fully, not staying tethered.


If you were forced to choose in a real conflict, the hard truth is this:
👉 Choose the future. Your mother’s role was to raise you to stand on your own, not to keep you tied forever.

I am a Tourist from Germany and Ive been in Sri Lanka for 2 weeks now, mostly in the south coast area.
First I want to say: I never thought I would love a country so fast and Ive traveled alot.
The regular people here are very kind and friendly.
And then you have the Tuktuk driver. 
We like to use Uber and PickMe to move around. But we had allready 2 situations when some Tuktuk Driver got mad as soon as we said that we have a PickMe Driver and they randomly wanted us to cancel that and drive with them - for a higher price of course lol.

One time they blocked the road and ganged up on our Driver, stole his phone and pushed him, glad the police was around although im not really sure they helped the right side because everybody wanted to put the blame on our driver instead. I told them it was not his fault obviously.

Prices are crazy too for a Tuktuk 

For example:
Tuktuk from Midigama to Ahangama: 1200 (2-4km)
Pickme: 385

Uber from Midigama to Galle: 3000 (25km)

How are the prices fair lol ofcourse tourists prefer the Apps!

Kind regards

My father is a fisherman & my mother is a home maker our home is near the beach. our house is made of thatched roofs at rainy seasons it rains inside our house too. I'm completely studied free education from grade 1 to UGC. Now I can proudly say that I'm a doctor but If it weren't  for free education, I would have gone to the sea to catch fish like my father & The matter is This man CWW.Kannnangara did a great job for our entire nation but he didn't get recognition well because of the ugly politics. He is not a Sinhala-Politician he is the politician of the nation just think about his vison Sri-Lanka was the first country to introduce free education from grade 1 to UGC to the world at 1943. Not only free education but also free breakfast & dresses & I'm recently saw a grade 5 Tamil book which has APJ.Abdhul-Kalam life story yeah he is good but see CWW.Kannangara is the reason of Sri-Lanka's today literacy rate but our peoples forgot him.

Fullr - basic with only sauces, a fixed crispy chicken patty and just sauce 
Dinemore Go - trying to be McDonald’s but missing the point. Burgers are small

Street Burger - still one of the best, continues with their quality 

Burger Hangover - does well, great burgers imo l, brings a very good balance and flavor on burgers there’s a lot of differentiation

1orrk8l,Scam going on at Burley's??,post,"Okay so, I like helping beggars. I give them food once in a while whenever I have the opportunity. And it always makes me feel good. Today, I was hanging out with a friend at Burley's when suddenly, a little girl (who looked like a typical street kid) came to our table and asked whether we could buy her something from the menu. Honestly, we didn't know what to do. We have never experienced something like this before, so we were dumbstruck. So we just went with the flow and took her to the counter where the menu was. Then she pointed out one of the most expensive things on the menu (A submarine which is a new arrival). The thing is, she didn't even take time to decide what she wanted; it's as if she already knew what to get. That's the moment I realised that this most probably wasn't her first time doing this. But since we already gave our word, we bought it for her. 

Now here's the part where it gets more frustrating. While my friend and I were waiting for the food, she went to another table and asked the people there to buy her some food too. That's when I confirmed that we indeed got somewhat scammed.. I lowkey wanted to go there and warn those people, but then I thought that since she's doing this because she and her mother (who was waiting outside the whole time) were hungry, I might as well just stay out of it.. After the food came, she took it and didn't even thank us. But her mother came inside and thanked us.. 

  
At the end of the day, I know that we did a good thing. But I don't feel good about it like I usually do. I feel like our kindness was taken for granted. And I didn't like her attitude, as if she expected us to follow her orders. I get that this is completely our fault, that we should have refused her from the beginning. But it's obvious she has done this before, so hasn't the Burley's staff noticed this? The guys at the other table also went to the counter with the girl so surely, someone must have noticed this. Maybe the staff is not doing anything about it because it's none of their business and it would be more profit for them.. I don't know. All I know is that if something like this happens again, I'm going to refuse even if it's a kid. So yeah, I just wanted to warn anyone who plans on going to Burley's, so that they won't be caught off guard like we were.",64,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1orrk8l/scam_going_on_at_burleys/,1762614132.0

1orqme9,Google Wallet in Sri Lanka,post,"Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm no expert on this, but what do you all think is the reason why Google Wallet doesn't support Sri Lanka?

First of all, while the whole world is moving towards cashless payments, we're in the Stone Age, acting as if cashless payment is a crime. Even the tuk-tuk buggers are unlikely to accept card payments. Even third-class sellers refuse to accept cards, or if they do, they charge an extra 3%.

However, at least a certain number of places—at least in the Western Province and other major cities—have some shops and services that do (it's not great, but it's something). If you take as cashless payment as percentage. Still very low in whole country. If you are in a banking sector, you should know the data. Lanka QR is also a good initiative. I heard that according to the recent national budget, the charges are 0% for transactions less than Rs. 5000/-.

I was curious why we still cannot add our cards to Google Wallet. And no, I don't mean the BYBIT cards that Dilshan Abeygunawardena and that SL Geek dude promote because you still have to change your location and all that. Why can't we just add any of our local VISA or Master whatever bank cards to Google Wallet in the right way? Is someone blocking it, like how Sri Lanka Customs held up the BYD imports? Is there a mafia behind this, like Sri Lankan payment gateway operators who may not want it to happen? We all know there have been certain childish cases in different sectors like electric vs. fuel car mafia. Tuk-Tuk mafia with Uber and PickMe. Bus conductors do not like the prepaid cards like that. the list goes on and on.

But seriously, I don't understand the reason behind it. Is it regulatory and market structure issues, central bank issue or is there a mafia behind it—like how fuel car importers don't like electric cars to be imported? Or, I mean, do people like Bhasha (Helakuru) only want their own apps to be used for payment?

What do you all think the reason is?",53,https://i.redd.it/hreznxcki10g1.jpeg,1762611744.0

You can decide on the payment per work. I’m open to any reasonable amount and flexible with time. My goal is simply to share what I’ve learned and help students reach their full potential and achieve the grades they aim for.

1ornrg7,It’s 2025 and apparently it’s still “illegal” for women to buy beer in Sri Lanka,post,"So I walked into a wine store today just to buy a beer — simple enough, right? Apparently not if you’re a woman.

The guy behind the counter looks at me and says, “Sorry, I can’t sell that to you. It’s illegal for women to buy liquor.” Then, as if that wasn’t absurd enough, he actually asks me if there’s a man with me who could buy it instead. Because obviously, women can’t be trusted with a can of beer.

And the cherry on top? He goes, “You can buy it from a supermarket, that’s okay.”
So it’s illegal here but magically legal next to the cereal aisle? Make it make sense 🤌

I just stood there wondering if I’d accidentally time-traveled back to the 1950s. It’s 2025, and women still have to argue for the right to buy a drink? Honestly, it’s both hilarious and depressing at this point.

I need some genuine advice from people who actually sit at a desk all day. I'm looking for a comfortable ergonomic office chair, but my budget is tight right now (max 30k LKR).

* **FB/Ikman:** Flooded with options, but hard to tell what's actually good for posture. 
* **Gaming Chairs:** I'm avoiding these. From what I've read on Reddit, the racing-style seats are bad for ergonomics and lumbar support.
* **High-end brands:** I know Herman Miller is the gold standard, but they are wildly expensive here now and completely out of my budget.

1or0gc8,Budget 2025 Public Transportation Allocation,post,"

Today, President AKD presented his second budget for the year 2026. First of all, what do you guys actually think about the budget?

I was never really interested in budget discussions before 2022, but after the financial crisis, I started thinking a bit deeper about the budgets that governments publish and what kind of real outcomes they produce within a year.

Anyway, the reason for this post is to get your thoughts on one specific area public transportation. I’ve been using public transportation daily for the past five years, both as a university student and now for work. I travel around 30–40 km daily using trains and public buses to and from Colombo.

Over the last five years, I honestly haven’t seen a single good improvement in public transportation, even with all the recent policy introductions that still haven’t been practically implemented in Colombo. If you’re someone who’s been traveling through Colombo Bus Stands or Fort Railway Station during this time, have you actually seen anything change for the better? As a daily traveler, do you feel any improvement in your quality of life?

Anyway, I’ll stop sharing my frustration here — you’re free to comment if you feel differently.

The main reason I’m posting this is because I saw in the news that the government has allocated 12,500 million LKR for importing vehicles for Parliament ministers. The President also stated that there will no longer be vehicle permits for ministers. At first, this might sound like a good move but the way I see it, public money will still have to be spent to manage and maintain these vehicles over the years.

Meanwhile, I also read that 3,600 million LKR which is just over a quarter of that amount  is being allocated to import 600 buses for the CTB for long-distance routes. That means each bus would cost around 6 million LKR. I’m not sure what kind of buses these are, but I’ve seen people mention that since this is a government purchase, it’s tax-free which makes me wonder, then, what kind of vehicles are we getting for 12,500 million LKR? 

12.5 billion for importing vehicles for personal luxury and 3.6 billion for a country with 20 million+ citizens shouldn't this be other way around. 

I also noticed another allocation of 3,300 million LKR for importing five trains. According to the Deputy Minister, by the time procurement ends and these trains actually arrive, it’ll be around 2028. If you’re someone who travels by train daily, you already know the situation — trains are being canceled or delayed even more than during the economic crisis. It’s honestly sad that these so-called ministers still can’t figure out the problem and are just asking people to wait until 2028.

As far as I know, the last time Sri Lanka imported commuter trains for short-distance routes was around 2013 — the S11 powersets. The trains imported after that were mostly for long-distance intercity travel. Nowadays, you see people hanging off the sides of trains without thinking twice about their safety — yet these so-called “genius” ministers are nowhere to be found.

And seriously, getting five trains in three years  what difference is that going to make? What are people supposed to do until then? If I remember correctly, the government also allocated over 500 million LKR in the previous budget for importing buses, but we haven’t seen a single one on the roads yet. Compared to other sectors, I honestly feel the allocation for public transportation is very low.

Personally, I believe improving the quality of public transportation is one of the best ways to enhance people’s quality of life — and it can have a massive positive impact on the country’s economy. These figures in the billions might sound big to some, but in reality, 3–5 billion LKR isn’t that much when you think about what’s needed to provide decent, basic public transportation — buses and trains — for the people.

If you’re interested, I’d really like to hear your honest opinions on this:

Do you think the government has made any justifiable improvements to public transportation over the past year?

Do you think it’s reasonable for ministers to ask for 2–3 more years to see any “real change,” when we haven’t seen even basic progress yet?

And finally — are you satisfied with the 2026 budget overall?",30,https://i.redd.it/lq72ald1dvzf1.jpeg,1762536202.0

So what I mean is, back in few months earlier, I was like how are you, are you going home, like that I asked dumb qs being trouble for her. I was being dumb ass person to ask those things. I think that's the cause of change, but when I ask if she is angry with me or something like that and she said ""no with my boyfriend also I don't message a lot now"".

1oqr6qw,5G Scam in Sri Lanka ----,post,"Since most Sri Lankans have short-term memory loss, I'm not quite sure if y'all remember the word ""5G."" Do you even remember when it was introduced to Sri Lanka, at least for name sake? As far as I believe, it was even before the Easter attack and covid19. Yet, we still have the same number of 5G signal towers with Dialog! Less than ten on the whole island.

They're only in certain areas like parts of Colombo, Negombo, Galle, and a few places like that. Not even in whole Colombo though.

But you know the shameless thing? These Dialog guys still shamelessly promote 5G campaigns. The only thing they have changed is the Dialog 5G logo, and even that was only slightly. Can you even believe that? This is real—not a joke, not sarcasm. For real!! Meanwhile, our phone companies promote 5G phones with cutting-edge slogans and all. Freaking awesome. There are third party 5G routers available to purchase though.

There are a lot of places where even 4G is not available. 5G is just hilarious. In China, correct me if I'm wrong, they already have 6G in limited areas. At the very least, we don't even have 5G in the Western Province, which has the most potential customer base.

When we call the Dialog hotline, the customer service reps, who are trained to provide lies, say the usual: ""It will be released soon."" That's the same excuse they've been giving for the past five or six years. It's just that the shameless marketing team runs campaigns from time to time, but the actual product is not available.

In most civilized and developed countries, you are not allowed to do such things. But we Sri Lankans don't have such restrictions anyway, so they promote it shamelessly. TRCSL is sleeping anyway. Not quite sure but there was a rumor, TRCSL was the reason 5G is restricted in Sri Lanka but then again no clue why Dialog still promoting it. It's not illegal to promote since they have few towers but isn't that just hilarious.

1oqppbr,Just saw this post on LinkedIn… and realized how far we still are from a modern mindset 😞,post,"I came across a LinkedIn post today by a fairly high-profile individual, a Deputy Minister, advertising for interns at the Ministry of Industry.

At first glance, it looks great: opportunities for research analysts, data analysts, and digital content creators. But then you read the fine print…

“You need to be an undergraduate from a local government university.”

That one line says so much about how far we still are from a modern, inclusive, merit-based mindset.

This isn’t to take a shot at SL local universities, there are incredibly talented students there. But limiting opportunities like this, especially for something that’s supposed to drive an industrial revolution, feels incredibly outdated and narrow-minded.

It’s just disappointing to see that even in 2025, we’re still clinging to these restrictive, box-ticking mindsets rather than focusing on skills, potential, and innovation.

Sri Lanka has so much untapped talent, both inside and outside the traditional university system. Until we start recognizing that, I’m afraid we’ll keep falling behind.

A 20-year-old man has pleaded guilty to murdering four children, their mother and a close family friend in a mass stabbing in Ottawa last year.

Febrio De Zoysa has also pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder for his attack on the father of the family, Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, who was seriously injured.


At the time of the stabbings on March 6, 2024, De Zoysa was a 19-year-old international student living with the Wickramasinghes in their basement in Ottawa's Barrhaven suburb.

He was arrested at the scene without incident and charged with six counts of first-degree murder the following day. 

6 dead including 4 children in Ottawa mass killing
De Zoysa stood with his lawyer Ewan Lyttle in Superior Court in Ottawa Thursday morning and pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder of the following victims:

• Share what content we’re making today

But , it takes around approx. 8-9 years, and the salary is not the best for the time spent on studying.

I’m asking from a place of curiosity and want to understand social, historical, and economic factors rather than judge anyone.

What factors — social, political, or personal — might lead individuals from different communities (Sinhalese, Muslim, Burgher) to sympathize with or support the LTTE?

We love nature and hiking, we want to get involved with locals and see your culture and cuisine as well :) 

We can’t decide whether it might be better to go to the south first and down our trip counter-clockwise due to the weather in the central areas at the moment.

1opxii8,Sri Lankan parents - are they mostly emotionally unavailable?,post,"Seen a few posts on this recently. In Sri Lanka, parents can be emotionally immature. Many are distant, self-involved or rejecting, while all the time controlling every aspect of thier kids. For example, the mom has to tell her older teenage son what shoes to wear for a wedding. Parents will not allow kids to take any small inconsequential decisions. Kids grow up unable to think for themselves and keep depending on parents for even small decisions. 

It drives me nuts when moms make their whole life about the child - in a very suffocating way. The kid internalizes a wierd idea of what love is - it is control. Guess what they will do to their life partners?

1opsxva,Sri Lankan Police Clearance issue – NIC not found in DRP system. Do we need to send NIC physically to Sri Lanka?,post,"Hi all,

I’m helping a Sri Lankan friend who currently lives in Luxembourg. She needs to get a Sri Lankan Police Clearance Certificate, but when applying online the system says that her NIC number cannot be found in the DRP (Department for Registration of Persons) database.

She definitely had an NIC before, but it seems her details were never digitized / recorded properly in the new system.

We are trying to understand the correct process.

Questions:

1. Does she need to apply for a new Smart NIC through the Sri Lankan Embassy in Brussels so her information gets registered again in DRP?


2. How long does it usually take for the Police Clearance system to recognize the new NIC after the embassy submits it?


3. Does the NIC card need to be physically sent to Sri Lanka for processing, or is everything handled electronically by the embassy and DRP?


4. If she can’t travel to the embassy soon, can she give Power of Attorney to someone in Sri Lanka to handle the NIC registration / Grama Niladhari part on her behalf?


5. Has anyone here gone through this recently — any timeline or advice?

6. Is there anyone here works at Department Registration of Persons (Sethsiripaya)? 


We are mainly unsure whether the physical NIC card needs to be couriered to Sri Lanka, because we want to avoid risks of it getting lost.

Any guidance or real experience would really help. Thank you!

1oprgx5,A Follow Up to My Last Post about BYD Customer Service (My take on this has changed slightly),post,"So, Last Friday I posted a [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1okyu6e/if_youre_considering_buying_a_byd_think_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about how bad BYD customer service has been in my experienced, and some asked me to provide a follow up about it so here it is.

The very next day (Saturday morning) they sent me photos of the finished vehicle, but I couldn't collect it right away because I need some release documents from the insurance company. So I collected my vehicle on Monday, and they had done a pretty good repair on it.

  
When I asked about the bad service, here's the reasons they provided:

\- They had missed a couple of parts in the initial estimation, and they had had to get them imported. And when importing, apparently the customs clearing process had taken a long time because the lawsuit that's been going on.

\- As a couple of redditors mentioned in the last post, they initially had not expected this much sales when they started to import. It had been 8 times more imports than they expected, so they've been struggling to scale so quickly, both in terms of warehouse facilities and employees.

\- When I confronted him about the terrible customer service, he just showed his call log with 200+ missed calls only within that day, and said they are really running short of employees and it has been really too much work for him to handle on his own, and said he's been working till 2-3 am every day, for the past couple of months. Even though that is not the most professional thing to say from his end, he seemed genuine and I really felt bad for him specially since I was mainly disappointed at the ""unprofessional behaviour of their employees"" when the issue was really with the company. After all they're also just employees working for a company, and to get a 10000 word rant on Reddit after working till 2 am must've been awful. On the plus side, he told me that they hired some new employees recently and that they're being trained atm.

  
On some closing notes, you still have to think twice when buying a BYD, not really because of the reasons I mentioned in the last post (bad employees), but because of the reasons some mentioned in the comments: the company is kinda struggling to keep up with the unexpected growth, but they will eventually catch up.

I really feel bad for going at the employees that hard lol. I even took some advice from a comment and reached out the dude's manager to report them. Which I now think I shouldn't have done.

Also, I think this post will not be very well received like the last post complaining them simply because how different my takes are in the two posts. But I thought I owed a follow up so that's why I made this post anyway. An also, in general rants tend to do well in this subreddit lol.

  
That said, like you might've guessed already I'm a bit gullible person so take all of these with a grain of salt.",208,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oprgx5/a_follow_up_to_my_last_post_about_byd_customer/,1762409948.0

1opo0rb,Reverted to Islam- what is my new identity?,post,"Hi guys! I have a somewhat unusual question and I’m unsure of how to handle it. So I am a guy from a Jaffna Tamil family raised in a Hindu environment but I have recently learned about the beauty of Islam. I had moved to Canada after the age of 10 with my family, and it is here that I was embraced by so many wonderful Muslims of various backgrounds in university and came to learn more about their faith. My parents are very supportive of my decision as they believe in the validity of all religions. However, a friend of mine had told me that if I were to fully revert, that I would no longer be considered a Tamil because Sri Lankan Muslims (Moors) are a unique community and are not Tamils according to official Sri Lankan regulations? Would I therefore be considered Moor now?

Growing up I guess I was surrounded by our typical Jaffna style cooking, clothing, language, etc and of course I am aware of the somewhat odd ways of how we Lankans classify ourselves. I have always considered myself as a Tamil person with a Sri Lankan nationality, but would this change if I reverted to my new faith that gives me so much peace? Would there be any issues with paperwork if I were to permanently return to my home country some day? Is there an exception to any documentation issues because Muslim people speak in Tamil? These issues of course will not impact my decision to change my religion, but I would like to know if this changes my ethnicity when in Sri Lanka",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1opo0rb/reverted_to_islam_what_is_my_new_identity/,1762398995.0

The thing is, she’s always careful.. she only goes out dressed like that when she’s with me or her mom, never randomly walking around alone or anything.

I just don’t get why people care so much. If she’s comfortable and safe, what’s the issue? Is it jealousy, outdated thinking, or just Sri Lankan culture being stuck in a loop? Genuinely curious how others see this.

1opg0g5,I think I just realised my parents never really loved me for me,post,"Sorry for the long post, but I recently came to a painful realisation that my parents didn’t actually love or even like me growing up. Looking back, what I thought was love was more like control or conditional approval.

I spent my whole life trying to earn their love by performing, achieving, being the “good” child, thinking one day I’d finally be enough. But when my partner loved me just for being myself, without expectations, I finally understood what real love feels like. And it broke me a bit, realising I’d been chasing something that could never be earned from my parents.

For some context:
	•	My mum talks a lot but barely ever listens. Whenever I open up about how I feel, she invalidates it right away and goes back to whatever topic she wants to talk about.
	•	My dad doesn’t seem to process emotions at all. His advice for everything is to “keep yourself busy” like doing another course instead of addressing the pain or the past.
	•	My younger brother was very abusive towards the girls in the house, but he always got away with it because he’s the “younger one.” I think he turned out so sexist partly because of my mum’s internalised misogyny.
	•	My sister keeps telling me “that’s just typical Sri Lankan parents” and that I should accept it.

But I can’t help wondering, is this really normal? Do some parents just have children to use them as pawns for their image, rather than because they genuinely wanted kids?

It hurts because I still genuinely love and care for them. Yet every time I did something well, they’d somehow find a way to gang up and tear me down again, like they didn’t want me to do better than them.

It’s really confusing and sad to process all this, especially in a culture that expects you to honour your parents no matter what.

Has anyone else here felt like their parents cared more about their reputation than their child’s wellbeing? If so, how are you dealing with it? ",65,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1opg0g5/i_think_i_just_realised_my_parents_never_really/,1762378500.0

1opaqsi,Feedback Needed Drop yours,post,"Feedback need guys❤️

Hey everyone,

I’m currently building a lingerie and wellness brand designed for Gen Z and young adults but with a different vision than most existing brands.

My goal isn’t to sell “sex appeal,” but to redefine intimacy and confidence helping people feel comfortable in their own skin, understand their preferences, and connect with themselves in a healthy, aware way.

I did a test run for about a year and made over 2,800 physical sales through small-scale marketing and direct community reach. Earlier, I tried partnering with an e-commerce platform (during the COVID era), but after I refused their commission model, they ended up copying my entire concept and product range. That experience pushed me to go independent.

Now, I’m preparing for my first official public launch this time in collaboration with healthcare  professionals to keep the focus on awareness and education, not just aesthetics.

Before I move forward, I’d love your thoughts as people who actually represent this generation:
	•	What do you think our generation is missing when it comes to body confidence and awareness?
	•	What would make you trust and engage with a brand in this space?
	•	What kind of products or campaigns feel authentic — not oversexualized or performative?

The business is fully registered and licensed, and I’m currently working on refining the storytelling and experience to make it something real, inclusive, and relatable.

Would love your honest feedback and ideas ❤️

1op9h9c,SimplyTek Sri Lanka charging 3.8k+ for store pickup — is this normal?,post,"Hey everyone,

Has anyone else noticed that SimplyTek Sri Lanka’s delivery and convenience fees have become ridiculously high? I was about to place an order worth around 77,000 LKR, and they’re asking for nearly 4,250 LKR just for delivery. Even if you choose store pickup, they still charge 3,850 LKR!

To me, that feels really unfair — and honestly a bit misleading. The listed prices look attractive at first, but when you actually proceed to checkout, you suddenly get hit with an extra 4,000 LKR in fees. That completely changes the final cost and doesn’t feel transparent.

Has anyone else experienced this recently? Are people still buying from SimplyTek despite these charges? It’s frustrating to see such high “convenience” fees, especially when you’re not even asking for delivery.

Curious if this is a recent change or if I just got unlucky with my order.

Here are a few details : 
I switched careers last year (2024) in November and moved to finance at 25 years old.  
Prior to my career switch, I had around 2.5 years of experience as a Junior Analyst but it was in a different field so my boss said they'll give me a junior Analyst position and a salary of LKR 130k (gross). He said that we can increase it later on after my probation if im good.
My probation ended in May 2025 and my salary didnt change. I got a little upset over it because I was expecting a raise because my seniors kept telling me I was good and one day one of them took me aside and said that everyones impressed with me so if by chance my boss doesnt give me a raise when my probation is done, to ask for it. This is the part where I was a bit dumb - when I got the fixed contract I didnt read it properly  because my boss was talking to me so I just signed the contract but when I looked at it properly a few minutes later after the meeting with my boss i realised I didnt get a raise. I was disappointed and honestly demotivated but too scared to ask my boss about it and thought that maybe ill wait a year to ask for a raise. Exactly a year has passed now, and I think its time I should ask for a raise. What do you guys think? At 26, isnt 130k really low given the current times (i think it is) ?

We are planning on visiting SL together this December and I’m kinda worried if we would face any backlash as he wears the turban and is visibly a Sikh guy. 

When we first started dating we faced a lot of disapproval from my parents and my other SL family members but his family was so welcoming and supportive of us. My SL extended family made a lot of comments on how I’m getting engaged to a “towel head” and many other discriminatory comments. So I’m sort of scared to visit Sri Lanka with him as I don’t want him to face any outwardly hostility. 

Plus he looks just like a Sinhalese man but with a turban so the only reason he would stand out is due to his turban and nothing else .",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1op2olj/nervous_to_visit_sri_lanka_as_an_interracial/,1762348885.0

1ooxgal,Customs holding packages and requesting insane tax amounts,post,"Hey folks, wanted to raise a question in the community on if this has happened to anyone else the past few months. 

I’ve been regularly ordering small-medium sized packages (think action figures and model kits) from Japan through EMS and they’ve always been delivered to my local post office with no issues. A couple months ago, around September, every single package I’ve ordered (all from the same website and same sizing plus prices) have been held by customs. 

The taxes vary by the custom officers moods and once I even received a ridiculous amount of 55k for three packages, and they “kindly” reduced it down to 26k. This is just absurd. Especially given that packages are just getting held up for no rhyme or reason, when asked why they say it’s the pricing but when I point out I’ve ordered stuff for the same amount before with no issues they don’t say anything. 

My best guess is they’re doing this to meet their tax goals for the year or something. I don’t get how every single package has been getting held up otherwise. I’ve seen even the tiniest stuff like a single tshirt getting held up.

Has this happened to anyone else? Did you also notice a shift like this recently? ",56,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ooxgal/customs_holding_packages_and_requesting_insane/,1762331191.0

1ootemp,Baahubali - The Eternal War Part 1 Teaser (Tamil). Why haven't our country tapped into it,post,"I am an animator, and I was really worried that our country does not have an animation industry. I create animated shorts and submit it to film festivals, 

 brief story about myself, I create animated shorts and submit it to film festivals, 

 when I said about animation to my family other people, they mocked me for getting into children's field and they did not have any understanding about it. 

They told there is no any stable job in animation and did not let me study it, but i managed to learn by myself for nearly 10 years and I can create animations. But no one in sri Lanka gave me support or encouraged me, everyone was just ignorant. 

Animation industry has been existed for more than 80 years now and still we have never explored it. All our people know is a few professions and never consider the talents of individuals. 

Let's see the truth, an average sri Lankan youth knows to operate a smart phone but not a computer. Because our education system is completely focused on theory than practical. We only manufacture scholars not talented people. We are blocking the creativity of our youth. 

I just saw this and India is getting in top of the game of animation. We always whine about countries like India but never thought of developing ourselves. When I wanted to study animation there were no standard institutions to teach them. Even our state universities does not even have a proper course for Vis. com (visual communication) (we are so backwards)

Are we done being ignorant. Just look at this, I feel sad that our country have is still conservative people and not letting us explore various fields. It was actually really hard to find an animation community in sri Lanka and still consider animation is just kid stuff. 

We don't have dreamers, innovators and creative people instead we create ripoffs from others. I have peo tv and they advertise some animations in sri lanka. Man, they look like made in the 90s. Really poorly made for the sake. We lack the newness are the talent of trying something new. I see many people running for tuitions everyday but no one seem to  learn something new that are not taught in our books or schools. 

We are always good at reasoning, they would say we don't have the audience or market to invest in animation. Actually, it's easy to establish a animation studio than big manufacturing companies. But we will never do that. Because we are always living in the older times. scared of exploring new stuff. From adults to children everyone are in a system that never let us think differently.

When will we make something like these. We are still amateurs.

Would love some help from locals or frequent travelers on:
🌄 Hiking / Nature: Best spots for short but scenic hikes — thinking places like Ella, Lipton’s Seat, or maybe something coastal?
🎶 Nightlife / Techno Parties: Are there any good techno or beach party scenes around that time? We’ve seen mentions of Mirissa, Weligama, and Ahangama — are those still the main hotspots in December?
🍛 Food / Local Culture: Any must-try local restaurants, markets, or cultural experiences that aren’t overly touristy?
☀️ Weather: What’s the weather typically like in early December? Any areas we should avoid due to rain?

Basically we’re after a balance of hiking, beach relaxation, good food, and late-night vibes — all while soaking in authentic Sri Lankan culture.
Any suggestions (itinerary ideas, local events, places to stay, or insider tips) would be hugely appreciated!

Now that I’m in uni, she wants me to do sports, join clubs. Basically, build fame in there. But i’m not one for fame, i never was and this is draining me a lot. 
Whenever she brings up the topic of joining the uni swim squad, I avoid it because I hate competing, I just like the sport, that’s all.

   I already have an account with **NSB,** but I’m not really happy with the benefits they offer. I also got a MasterCard from them (which is actually a Visa card) specifically for international online payments, and guess what, it still doesn’t work. They told me I needed to fill out a form to activate international transactions, which I did twice. Both times it was rejected for some ridiculous reason (their excuse is the signature i use to sign in form and signature in my Id needs to be exact same, like a copy, no same-match)

I know it’s a bit naive to expect good digital services or flexibility from a government bank, but compared to other state banks, NSB’s rates and benefits felt lower overall. Private banks aren’t really my first choice due to financial risk concerns, but I don’t mind considering Commercial Bank since it feels more stable. also in the Stocks too..

So I want to hear from you all..
• Which banks are you using?
• How are the interest rates, online payment options, and international transaction support?
• Are their mobile apps reliable and user-friendly?
• Any pros/cons or personal experiences would help a lot.

Unfortunately I cannot go on this trip any earlier in the year, I will be flying in on the second week of May, flying out the first week of June. Three weeks in Sri Lanka. 

Does anyone have any experience being in Colombo in May and travelling eastwards? How bad is the weather? did it disrupt your trip? Do flights get cancelled? 

I have been in Thailand/Malaysia at the start of their rainy season and found my travel was not disrupted. Heavy short showers, usually in the morning but no flooding. I am hoping the west coast of Sri Lanka might be the same.  


I have not booked flights yet as I am doing my research first. If anyone has been in Colombo in May/June I would love to hear your experience as I am considering not going to Sri Lanka because of my fear of being stuck in Colombo.

1ongddk,Has anyone in Sri Lanka ordered books from Blackwells? Need advice on taxes and process!,post,"Hey everyone,

I'm hoping to get some clarity from those of you who have imported books directly from Blackwells UK.

Like many of you, I usually rely on our local online stores (jumpbooks, CGA, Flashbooks.lk, pickabook.lk, Wild and the Sage, etc.) for my physical books, and my Kindle for everything else. But I've been wanting to order a specific book that's hard to find here, and Blackwells says they ship to Sri Lanka.

I actually placed an order, but cancelled soon after for a couple of reasons:

1.  Taxes & Hidden Costs: The final price only showed the book cost and said shipping was included. It didn't add any separate import taxes or customs fees. I've heard horror stories about having to pay a lot extra to the post office here upon delivery.

2.  Payment Timing: My card wasn't charged immediately. I read that Blackwells only deducts the money when the item is dispatched. This is different from what I'm used to, and it made me a bit nervous.

So, for those who have taken the plunge:
a) What was your final experience like? Were there any surprise charges from Sri Lanka Customs or the post office when you received your package?
b) How does the payment work? Was it smooth, and did the amount charged at dispatch match your initial order total?

1onexcv,Don’t waste your money studying at BCAS Kandy Campus,post,"I'm currently studying at "" BCAS Kandy Campus "", and honestly, I wouldn’t recommend this place for studying "" Software Engineering "".

The main reason is that "" what they show on their website is not what they actually teach "". The syllabus looks modern online, but in reality, they teach "" outdated content "" and give "" old assignments "".

They don’t teach any modern technologies, and even the software they use is outdated. Some subjects feel completely "" useless and unrelated "" to our field.

Even the "" assignments are poorly prepared "" — they contain "" a lot of grammatical errors "", "" incorrect question numbers "", and "" structural issues "". They don’t look or feel like **professional academic assignments** at all.

A few lecturers clearly struggle to deliver proper lessons and seem to "" lack knowledge "" about the subjects they teach. Because of this, I’ve started to "" doubt the qualifications "" of the lecture panel.

When it comes to the campus environment, it’s also disappointing. The "" canteen is in a terrible condition "" — I can’t even call it a canteen anymore because "" they don’t serve any food "", and I’ve even "" seen rats "" there. The "" library doesn’t have enough space "" for students to study, and sometimes we have to leave because some lecturers use the library for their own work.

Another issue is how they "" force students to buy things "". For example, they once tried to sell a t-shirt claiming it was “compulsory.” They also often say things like “if you don’t participate, you’ll be downgraded” or “bring proof that you attended” — especially for things like "" useless HSU meetings "".

They also once said we would go on a "" field visit "", but that "" never happened "". It was just an empty promise, and honestly, a "" complete lie "".

Finally, the "" reception staff is unhelpful "". I once asked for help with something important, but they didn’t care at all.

Lastly, don’t waste your money studying here. Find a better institute with a qualified lecture panel that actually cares about students and their education.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1onexcv/dont_waste_your_money_studying_at_bcas_kandy/,1762184115.0

But despite that, my family constantly insults me even my younger brother and sister. I’m the oldest, yet they still call me things like “wdakata nathi eka” and “pawlata bara eka.”
Both of my parents are professors at a government university, and they often mock me because of my salary. I currently earn around 80k, but they keep comparing me to my friends who make 150k or more. They also compare me to their colleagues’ children who got into medicine or engineering.

I actually got selected for architecture at Moratuwa University, but I didn’t like that field, so I decided to switch paths and study software engineering at a private university instead. Even though I’m working hard and doing my best, the constant criticism and comparisons never stop.

Whenever I try to speak up, my parents defend my siblings instead. I know I’m grown ass man, but it really hurts to be mocked every day especially by my own family.
Right now, I’m focusing on building some side hustles so I can move out next year, but with my current salary, it’s not possible yet.

1on7hoc,The Simple Trick to Bypass Customer Care Bots and Talk to a Real Human Fast!,post,"**TL;DR:** Save the customer service number with a **comma** and the button sequence (e.g., `0117100100,11411`) to jump the robot line and talk to an agent immediately!

\--- ✄ -----------------------

The key to bypassing the long menu options (the IVR) and speaking directly to an agent is using the **comma (**`,`**)** in your saved contacts.

* **What it does:** The comma acts as a **""pause""** when dialing. (one comma for \~2 secs pause, two for \~4 secs pause ..)
* **How to use it:** Find the sequence of buttons needed to reach a human agent (e.g., 1-1-4-1-1). Save the number with the comma and the sequence immediately after the main digits.

**NOTE:** Using a `;` instead of `,` will ask for your confirmation for sending the sequence.

**Example:**

If the main number is `0117100100` and the path to a human is `11411`, save the number as: `0117100100,11411`

Your phone dials the number, **pauses** after connecting to the automated system, and then **automatically inputs the** `11411` **sequence** for you, connecting you straight to the agent queue.

**Few Tested Examples:**

1. Dialog Broadband Hotline : `0117100100,11411`
2. Mobitel Post Paid Hotline : `0712755777,,262`  \- Extra `,` For a longer pause, Mobitel needs a longer pause.
3. CEB Hotline (without acc. number, faster) : `0112266266,14**` \- Double `*` to skip entering the account number (It doesn't have to be a star).
4. CEB Hotline (with acc. number, slower) : `0112266266,14[ACCOUNT_NUMBER]1` \- replace `[ACCOUNT_NUMBER]` with your 10-digit account number.
5. Combank Generic Hotline: `0112353353,14`
6. Combank Digital Hotline: `0112353353,129`
7. Dialog Post Paid Hotline : `0777678678,1#`  \- `#` to skip the lengthy voice-over.

**Where This Trick is Most Useful:**

This trick saves you the most time whenever you call a number with a predictable menu system. Here are a few places you can use it:

* **Customer Care Hotlines:** (Dialog, Mobitel, Banks) - Getting straight to a **billing** or **technical support agent**.
* **Bank Hotlines:** Quickly getting to the **Credit Card department** or freezing a lost card.
* **Hospital and Clinic Bookings:** Bypassing the operator and getting straight to the **appointments desk** (especially those busy hospital lines).
* **Insurance Companies:** Directing your call to the **Claims department**.
* **Government/Utility Services:** Reaching the specific desk for **connection or payment inquiries**.",305,https://i.redd.it/5ku26hx3h0zf1.jpeg,1762162802.0

1on1l56,Psychotherapy in Sri Lanka,post,"Have come across a number of people who have complained about unpprofessional counselors in SL. Thought to write a few guiding tips on how to spot a professional psychotherapist. 

*  Starts on time - is not late. 
* Fees, session duration and qualifications are easily accessible. 
* You will not feel judged. 
* You will feel at ease in the relationship that is being built with the counselor. 
* Counselor is open and honest. 
* Counselor does not jabber on for half the session. 
* Counselor does not disclose personal details - unless it is highly relevant to your situation. 
* The therapy session is not a tea party - the counselor doesn't waste you money talking pleasantries.
* COunselor doesn't dish out advice - but guides you to open up your thinking and come to your own decisions. 
* Counselor doesn't doze off. 
* You don't feel ridiculed or shamed. 
* As therapy progresses, you begin to see where it is heading. 
* Counselors remembers you and your story.

1on0q6a,DONT GO TO SPOKEN ENGLISH CLASSES TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE.,post,"So recently I have seen an inclined rate in Spoken English Classes in Sri Lanka. Every time when I am scrolling through Facebook a teacher comes out with a made up accent stating its the best class bla bla and you dont need to have the vocabulary to speak English. I dont know if any of those online classes for adults are working for the ones who are going. But if you need a paper qualification for a certain promotion you should probably do a Diploma or something but if you are trying to learn English to use in your day to day life dont ever step into an online class because that wont be effective in the long run and it will be a loss of your time and money. My personal experience in learning English is reading a book out loud ,reading subtitles out loud in a movie, Chatting with a foreigner and this one is kinda personal favorite of mine and it has given me a vast knowledge of the English vocabulary, idioms and slangs and that is going through old school raps. I have scrutinized every damn word and I have learned many new words to enhance the language. So basically what I am trying to say is you only need to have the eagerness to learn the language. When you have the need it automatically transforms your brain to achieve that goal using any means necessary. Because a teacher will teach you every word and every grammar in a class but after that its all up to you explore and learn. I have seen many people who went abroad with only a little knowledge of english becoming pros in speaking English. So its all up to you lads. Write,read,explore, talk with yourself in English by imagining yourself in an interview or try to talk about something you love about in English. At first you will fail but over time you will have the confidence and the skill to talk about anything anywhere anytime. You only wanna know the ABCs in the alphabet. You dont need grammar. Just forget about it and read every book out loud and listen to native English speakers to see how they pronounce their words. This is a language not rocket science. So dont waste your time going to online classes. Invest that time to read an article or a book in English. When you are reading out a language it also boosts your confidence to speak it. Confidence is the key to learn a new language and reading out loud and talking it out loud with yourself while you are alone will boost it. The beginning wont be easy. You will fail and get mocked by wannabe posh lankans if you mispronounce a word. But remember their mocking will be your success to be better in every damn way possible!!! So keep your chin up and fly high lads❤️",50,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1on0q6a/dont_go_to_spoken_english_classes_to_learn_the/,1762138523.0

1ommsq6,First-time visitors - rate our itinerary,post,"My wife and I are traveling to Sri Lanka (from the US) for a week in late January and (with ChatGPT's help) have put together a general idea of an itinerary, but would love the community's thoughts on it.  Some notes: we're heading to the Maldives for a few days afterwards, so beaches aren't a top priority; we've been on safari a few times (both in India and in Africa) so things like elephant-watching aren't a top priority; she's most interested in birding, with a little bit of culture (temples etc.) in the mix as well; we're getting to the middle-aged stage where creature comforts are welcomed over truly rustic experiences. Oh, and we'd hire a driver for the week. With that in mind, here's what we've sketched out:

Jan 28: Land in Colombo in the wee hours of the morning. *Probably* have a driver pick us up and take us to Sigiriya (Jetwing Vil Uyana).  Alternatively, see if we can find a boutique hotel to catch up on a few hours' sleep, but we got business class flights on miles so hopefully will be at least somewhat rested.

Stay in t for two nights. View Royal Gardens, do some hiking, some birding (Ritigala?), relax

Jan 30: Drive to Kandy via Matale spice gardens and/or Aluvihara. Stay at W15 Hanthana Estate two nights. Visit Temple of the Sacred Tooth, Udawattakele Sanctuary for birding

Feb 1: Take the Blue Train from Kandy to Nanu Oya, then transfer to Ceylon Tea Trails for one night.

Feb 2: Spend the day at Tea Trails; do some hiking or kayaking, then drive to Sinharaja (Boulder Garden resort) for two days - birding w/ naturist, hang by the pool, etc.

Feb 4: morning at Boulder Garden, then drive to CMB for an early evening flight to Male.

Thoughts? Recommendations?

1omlu6d,Has modern media failed Sri Lanka in race relations?,post,"Seeing some posts about a Tamil DJ facing racial abuse. Also seeing baby haamu (you know who) getting more and more media visibility...

When I was a kid, my favourite music video was J Town Story by Iraj and co. It completely changed the way I think about ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. As a Sinhalese, I stopped thinking from black and white terms about everything. I started reading about people like Gandhi, Mandela and realised that they were not black and white people. I honestly thought artists like Yathavan, Infaas, Gajan and Dinesh were amazing because they looked like people I encountered everyday in Colombo.

But that was the last time I was genuinely moved by Sri Lankan media.

Nowadays I look around and I cannot see any representation in popular media. Maybe I am looking at wrong places.

Mega teledramas are all representing Sinhalese. Are there any good tamil/ moor representation?
Who is the new Gajan and Dinesh?
Do I have to step into my liberal bubble to see other cultures represented?
Why there are no Tamil politicians in my screen? Why all the political discussions in Sinhalese? Are we excluding Tamil community from political debate?

For me, politics is always downstream from culture. If you do not change the culture, you cannot change politics. I think we are stuck and waiting for a saviour to save us. I think it's time the media executives in big companies to step up. It's time for us to demand better and positive representation.

Utmost priority is safety, comfort, and style in that order. Preference is for a family sized SUV (7-seater) and **i'm not considering anything above LKR 40Mn**.

I know the NEVs may incur significant depreciation (IMO) and could be a write-off down the line ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ and hence my focus is mainly on ICE/PHEV's. I just want to get him a good brand new car with agent/manufacturer warranty which he can use without any issues for 3-5 years before I swap it later on.

Options (prices based on a quick online research and I'm not sure if they are up-to-date):

**BYD** (I saw some posts here in Reddit regarding after sales issues at JKCG which is a concern. But being JKH I hope they will rectify it sooner than later.)

* 22Mn - Sealion 6 PHEV (will they launch Sealion 7 in SL soon? If so this is moot)
* 18Mn - Sealion 5 PHEV

**Chery** (wasn't my first choice, but the Tiggo 9 and the T2 looks great and they are closely behind BYD in China and are gaining traction with their new sub-brands Jetour and Omodoo/Jaecoo in other markets):

* 29Mn - Chery Tiggo 9 PHEV (concerned on the re-sale aspect)
* 26Mn - Jetour (by Chery)T2 (Luxury trim) PHEV (strong preference given the price)
* 23Mn - Jetour (by Chery) T2 PHEV

**Kia** (previously used one and I like the brand and better re-sale value than above for sure)

* 33Mn - Sorento
* 37Mn - EV9
* 35Mn - Carnival (MPV - a little too big for his use but looks good and priced well for this category)

**Hyundai**

* 37Mn - Santa Fe (not sure why some dislike the design; I think it looks good)

I have looked at other NEV offerings such as Changan/Deepal, DFSK, GWM, GAC, Leapmotor, Skywell and I'm not particularly impressed nor interested in them.

**Any other 7-seater SUV options that I should consider (even non PHEVs) in the above price range? If so please let me know.**",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1omacf0/midrange_suv_7seater_options_in_sl_for_late2025/,1762065122.0

I’m planning to buy a 12,000BTU inverter AC and came across the Abans 12000BTU R32 Inverter Anti-Corrosion Air Conditioner. Model :  ABLGIN-12R32ANTI

I’ve got a deal for Rs. 143,000, which includes installation and a 10-year compressor warranty. Sounds pretty decent, but before I pull the trigger, I’d love to hear from anyone who’s actually using this model (or any Abans-branded AC in general).

1. How’s the cooling performance and power efficiency?
2. Is it quiet during operation?
3. Any issues with after-sales service or parts availability?
4. How does it compare to other brands like Hisense, TCL, or Gree?

Would really appreciate your experiences, good or bad — trying to make an informed decision here! 🙏

1om73bq,"AL students, Don't be afraid to retake the exam because of aging...",post,"I see a lot of people in this sub recommending private universities, saying that trying another year is a waste of time. But that simply isn’t true. The average life expectancy in Sri Lanka is 77 years, and you’re only 20. There’s a huge difference between the regret of failing after trying and the regret of not trying at all.

That aside, if you’re middle class or lower, a government university is the most viable, cheapest, and best option for you. Most of my middle class friends who went to private universities did so by taking student loans. The interest rate might be small, but it’s still a fucking loan. And being in debt in your 20s is not a good start.

Plus, what are you so eager for that you can’t wait another year? To be busy and tired all the time? My point is, adulthood isn’t what we thought it would be as kids. It really isn’t.

There are millions of reasons not to retake the exam and to enroll in a private university. But aging isn’t one of them. It never was.",98,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1om73bq/al_students_dont_be_afraid_to_retake_the_exam/,1762053810.0
1om6wqs,What’s Really Going On With Sri Lankan IELTS Classes?,post,"My brother recently got an internship, so he started preparing for IELTS. We spoke to several IELTS ads on Facebook and, Jesus Christ, they were absolutely bullshitting. They claim all sorts of things, but some of them can’t even pronounce basic words. I’m sure there are good ones too, but this was another level. They kept harassing us to register, and then it turns out the “class” is 50+ students in an online session where everyone just sits in front of the screen, takes notes like it’s A/Ls, or spends the whole hour doing writing tasks, not even in a proper mock exam environment.
So we decided to go with self-study and found a really good mock exam and feedback platform. So fingers crossed for this arrangement. Please think twice before you get trapped by these so-called IELTS gurus. Do your research before you pay. We later found out that one of the teachers was just a random guy in Romania with zero English qualifications and who has never even taken IELTS himself.

Just thought of leaving this here.

I’m 25 and just graduated last month. I’ve been working for about 3 months now (wfh), and my current take home salary is around LKR 200,000. I’ve managed to save up a bit already and I’m thinking of starting some investments soon.

Here’s what I’m planning so far:

1. Unit trusts (for some stable, diversified growth)
2. Emergency fund (in a fixed deposit)
3. Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) — I actually have some prior experience investing there about 3–4 years ago.

Apart from these, I’m wondering if there are other smart investment options I should look into, maybe gold, or even real estate? I know real estate has low liquidity, so I’m not sure if that’s the best move at my age.

1oljo0q,"Employee refusing to pay wages, should I ignore or fight back?",post,"Writing this here, cause I have no where to ask but there's the context,

Few weeks before. I did applied for a job, small and compact store and located at top floor. One person to handle everything Not many visiting customers. But as days passed by, things did started to get abit difficult for me, 

Example - hence the store is located at top floor its boiling heat. Only allowed to switch on the AC when customers come in but switching on the ceiling fan makes it worse. So I use to keep open the back door for ventilation. 

Another incident is water, The water is not always available, usually comes after 3pm. So if in any urgent case to use the Washroom I do have to hold till water comes 

I did tried managing for couple of days but it was tough, hence I joined for full time initially, they did said I need to sign a contact but after 2 week of joining no sign of contract so I thought this is the chance to leave. Cause it does not suite me, Talked with the owner and all cool parted ways.

Hence i worked for 2 straight weeks, made plenty of sales, I thought of asking the owner if I am eligible to receive the wages for days i have worked, the reply was hence me leaving caused them more trouble & they dont pay for induction days and hence there's no contract signed so they won't be any paycheck.

I'm struck whether should I leave it or fight back. Cause the wages comes near 18-19k.

Your opinions are appreciated 😊

1olggsp,My experience as a verbally abused by teachers in my school.,post,"I studied in one of the popular girls secondary elite school. I am from a rural area and studied in a small rural primary school. I entered in grade 6 with hopes and dreams. 
The experience?
It was worst.
Teachers treat students partially based on their backgrounds. Some people got princess treatment from teachers while us got only scolding from them. In gr 6, some girl from elite backround stumbled on my leg and fell on the floor, it was because I stretched my leg a little for numbness. She complained it to our neighbour classroom teacher, instead of ours. The teacher called me and made that girl go and then scolded me that I am the wrong one here because I stretched my leg, not her walking without looking. I still remember the impact even after years and years. I still remember another teacher bullied me in gr 6 because I don't know the exact name of my father's work and tried to describe it. She made me stand before those 30+ students and bullied gave me a name. For many months those classmates made fun of me of that name.
And one teacher scolded me, because I told her that I didn't know how to do the exercise in my english book, that's why I didn't do it. If that's from their favourite students, or elite students. They will go on a zen mode and even go to the end of the world to teach them. 
Why no one talk about these partiality? Partiality exist everywhere, but in childhood is terrific. 
Those events broke my confidence and everything. Even, sometimes I struggle to talk properly or stand out before others. The government is paying for teaching all students not for some particular elite people. We wear white uniform to show equity. But, is there any real equity? Nope.
Rural schools teachers way more better than those elite school teacher. After my experience, I didn't want to send my sister to that elite ***, and made her to study nearby. She's scoring good and teachers are very well dedicated.
And this is my experience, and there are many of them like me. Most of us silent about this matter, thinking that scolding is good for our life. Scolding for wrongs are important.
 But, these types of scolding? No. It'll destroy another child's life. Like it destroyed me.",98,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1olggsp/my_experience_as_a_verbally_abused_by_teachers_in/,1761976761.0

1oldk3h,"Human Rights violations in Sri Lanka: | Daily Mirror, 🤔🤔🤔🤔",post,"Seems like you have taken trips to north in your recent visits. And you have explicitly mentioned that violence and torture had taken place there.

What about the atrocities done by LTTE, are the Sinhalese and Muslim people lesser beings. Did we not suffer, did we not live in fear.

Seems UN is preaches but they segregate humans by what will be most useful for them to disrupt a country or bring shame.

Pity...


Honestly! ones lived through the decades, share your stories. 

That crippling fear of not being sure whether you would see your loved ones coming back home, may it be going to work or school. We lived in fear. 

I remember the final match between a rival country and our nation's lions telecast on local tv. Everybody tuned in. But I went to bed early, 

Sometime in the night I heard explosive sounds, I said to my self, our boys have had won the match and people are celebrating by lighting crackers.

But that day the sound I heard was different, not like crackers exploding In the distance, but had a deeper and profound sound. I got up and went to the tv lobby to check, if my family and friends were celebrating. 
Nope! They were outside, looking towards the sky.
Then it became apparent, the loud explosives were caused by AA guns, firing in to the night sky. Small lights were observed followed by the exploding sound I mentioned earlier.

Apparently, they were firing at the aircraft piloted by an terrorist. Fear quickly assimilated in our hearts,  electricity was cut off. 

I was the closest experience I had with war brewing outside our home. I felt helpless I had no place to go. Crippling fear I will never forget.

1okyu6e,If you're considering buying a BYD... THINK AGAIN,post,"EDIT: Literally a day after I posted this (not saying it’s related, could be a coincidence), they sent me photos of the finished job.

EDIT: Made a [follow up post to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oprgx5/a_follow_up_to_my_last_post_about_byd_customer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), you might want to check that as well, since my thoughts from this post have changed.

TLDR: It's been two months for a simple repair and I still haven't received my vehicle from them.

So I bought my BYD a few months ago, and don’t get me wrong I love the car but this is about their after sales customer service.

So here’s the timeline:

* TWO MONTHS AGO (3rd of Sept): A bike hit me from the side, both front and rear doors were damaged in driver’s side.
* Sep 4 : I visited the BYD service center in Kurunegala, and they told me it will take months to get it done from there, and recommended me to get it done from their Colombo service center. So I contact a “service advisor” they appointed from Colombo showroom, and he asks me for some photos of the damaged parts so he can make an estimation to submit to the insurance company.

I of course submitted them right away, but heard nothing back from them.

A week passes by, still nothing, and they won’t respond to my calls. Then I decided to visit the Colombo service center and see what's up.

* Sep 11: I took my car to the service center, and the service advisor took some photos and I believe that's when he started preparing the estimation
* Sep 14: He finally sends me an estimation, and that had an incorrect model on it, and it took another two days for him to fix that.

After I receive the estimation, he said that all the parts have already arrived Sri Lanka, and we'll be able to start the repair process in a week.

Two more weeks pass by, nothing from them, the service advisor deliberately dodges my calls. Sometimes he would say something like ""I'm logging in to the system to check on this, and will get back to you right away"" and hangs up, and then again won't answer any of my calls for weeks. To say he was unprofessional would be an understatement.

He finally asks me to drop the vehicle off at Colombo service center at Oct 3rd.

* Oct 3rd: When I visit there, they again told me it would take another week if I do it from their colombo showroom, and asked me to drop it off at their newly opened Wattala service center. Once I visit Wattala, thei appointed a new service advisor, and he said basically this has been stalled for the past two weeks, and apparently the dude from Colombo had done nothing.

I was still cool with it, just dropped the vehicle off at Wattala and they said it would be ready by Oct 17 (spoiler alert, it was not).

From there onwards, they did not answer any of my phone calls/messages for two weeks, and their complains hotline was also useless.

* Oct 22: They sent me a couple of photos saying the repair process has started, and I was a bit relived, and they told me it will be ready by Oct 27 (spoiler alert, it was not).

The last week passes by they keeps delaying it, and told me they will finalise the documents with insurance by Oct 30, so I can come and collect the vehicle on 31st.

* Oct 30 (yesterday): I was prepared to visit there today (Oct 31st) and just to be sure, I made a call, and they told me some documents are still not ready with the insurance, and they will for sure get it ready by 31st evening so I can just come and collect the vehicle tomorrow morning.
* Oct 31 (today): I've made plans to visit there there tomorrow (mind you, I'm visiting there from Kandy) and called them to make sure. They asked me to collect a document from the insurance company, and after that I can collect the vehicle tomorrow.

So I called the insurance company and they said when their TO visited BYD workshop, the vehicle was still not done, and apparently they're asking me to come and collect the vehicle tomorrow because they know the insurance companies don't work on weekends and I for sure can't get the release documents from them tomorrow.

So afterall, it's been two months since I first reached them for a repair (a repair that would at most take 1 week. It's hardly even a repair. They just had to replace the parts) and still couldn't get it done. To make it worse, they have been very unprofessional throughout this, not transparent at all, been lying to get some more time. Not to mention, throughout these two months I had to constantly call them and see if the repair is progressing. Even then they would lie about the progress. It was so frustrating. It's safe to say that is is BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have received from any company.

If you're someone who's thinking of buying a BYD- think again.  
If you're someone who's already bought one- drive safely. Their aftersales service is worse than sh#t.",362,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1okyu6e/if_youre_considering_buying_a_byd_think_again/,1761927213.0

1oknqv4,"Followed a strict 3-week diet plan, and my doctor completely shamed me for 3 cheat meals 😢",post,"Hi Reddit, I just need to vent because I’m still shaken.
I started a strict diet plan given by a very famous dietitian for 3 weeks. He asked to come back in 3 weeks. So, I followed it perfectly, even through a terrible flu that lasted the first 2 weeks. Sandwich for breakfast, steamed veggies & rice for lunch and supplement for dinner. He didn’t ask to do any workouts and I didn’t do any workouts too because I was exhausted by flu, but I stayed on the diet faithfully and lost 3kg in 3 weeks.

During the 3 weeks, I had 2 nights out for drinks (without heavy meals just chicken as snacks) and one cheat breakfast/lunch, which I thought was reasonable. Today, when I went to see him, he shouted at me and said I had no dedication and told me to “come back in one year, when you have no parties or other commitments” before we’d start again. Then he started to give some normal meal plan, “so you can eat snacks and pulses etc, eat a normal diet” and so and so. While I was trying very hard not to burst in to tears, I asked I’m planning to start gym sessions in few days are there any specific plan I should follow? Then he sarcastically said that in my case I’d need to “run at least 10 km daily or lift 80 kg to lose weight.” I didn’t even get a chance to explain I was sick.

I cried a lot after leaving (and trust me I’m not a crying person). I feel like I did everything I could under the circumstances, and the fact that he dismissed my efforts just because of two-three meals out feels… incredibly harsh and unfair. I’ve been sick, tired, and recovering while still sticking to his plan, and yet I was treated like a failure.

My friends and my husband told me the doctor was being idiotic, but I’m still haunted by the experience. Imagine saying something like this to anyone struggling with weight — it’s humiliating and could easily crush someone’s confidence. I just feel like no matter how much effort I put in, it can be invalidated by someone’s ego.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of shaming from a healthcare professional? How did you handle it and move on without letting it mess with your confidence or progress?",63,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oknqv4/followed_a_strict_3week_diet_plan_and_my_doctor/,1761893902.0

So lately I've noticed many times uber tuk drivers cancelling the ride midway without checking when the payment is on card.

No checking whether you have cash at hand. You've already gotten in. Ride is midway already almost near to the destination.

Suddenly your app won't show the ride anymore cus the driver has cancelled it.

This has happened to me several times now.

Upgraded from cash or card before beginning the ride to cancelling the ride midway without proper notice. 

So be aware and be careful for your own sake. 


( As a suggestion, Uber should implement a method where the Uber drivers aren't able to cancel a ride once it's verified and trip started until it reaches destination  OR 

if there's any requirement to do so, It should be done with both parties agreeing through the app it self )",36,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1okmrzh/uber_midway_cancellations_by_drivers/,1761890053.0

1oklnbt,Don't do the HND and Degree programs in Nebula Institute Of technology,post,"# Honest Review: SLT Mobitel Nebula Institute of Technology (HND in EEE & UH Program)

I want to share my honest experience regarding the **HND in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** and the **UH top-up program** offered at Nebula Institute of Technology (affiliated with SLT Mobitel).

In my opinion, this program does **not provide real educational or practical value** for students who wish to build a strong career as an engineer. Here’s why:

* The **HND program mainly focuses on assignments** instead of proper examinations or practical-based evaluations. In today’s context, many assignments can easily be completed using AI tools like ChatGPT, so there’s little genuine learning or assessment happening.
* The **UH top-up program** structure is different from the one offered by SLIIT. The modules are outdated, and there’s **no real technical or industry-relevant content** being added at advanced levels.
* After completing these programs, **graduates are not recognized as engineers** for professional positions or registration purposes in Sri Lanka.
* The **training provided through Telecom Sri Lanka** is very limited and doesn’t add much professional exposure or skill development.
* The **management seems more focused on financial gain** than improving educational quality or providing genuine student support.
* Even the **Cybersecurity and Digital Technology programs** seem poorly structured, with students lacking basic understanding of their subjects.

If you are planning to pursue an **Electrical and Electronic Engineering** related degree, I strongly recommend looking into **CINEC**, **SLIIT International**,SLTC  or other recognized universities.  
These institutions provide **updated modules**, **industry relevance**, and **better academic standards**.

Overall, based on my personal experience, I do **not recommend** doing the HND or UH programs in EEE at Nebula Institute of Technology.",86,https://i.redd.it/mq9a1bwvmdyf1.jpeg,1761885933.0

1oka6g1,Sri Lanka's Parents problem,post,"I'm a foreigner, working in Colombo. There was a female employee in our company. She worked incredibly hard, never being late. She came from the countryside, and in Colombo, she was staying at a boarding house.

Last 3month ago, she suddenly absent at work (she hadn't been late in a year!). I asked her what was wrong, and she just kept crying. She said she's feeling unwell, so I tried to comfort her and told her talk later. The next day, she hadn't shown up and we couldn't reach her, so our HR contacted her emergency contact (her mother), and she told me they'd sent her abroad.

Even until this story, it makes me dizzy, but there's something more.

Today suddenly her mom contact me (she said her daughter gave my contact), and say to me rent some money for her study. And after she's starting work, she will pay back to me. it's not from her, but her mom's.

How could this be? It felt like something straight out of a drama, happening in real life. She's in her mid-20s, a fully grown adult. How could her parents make such arbitrary decisions? I just can't understand. Of course, I've been really surprised to see so many applicants to our company bring their parents to their interviews.

My partner and I are heading to Sri Lanka Jan 7–20 — planning to stick to the southwest since it’s the best weather. We urge to have a mix of beach, nature, culture.
  
Rough plan:

-   Negombo (1 night) – rest after landing
-   Ella (3 nights) – train ride, tea fields, hiking
-   Tangalle (4 nights) – quiet beaches, turtles
-   Mirissa/Weligama (4 nights) – surf, whales, sunsets
-   Galle (2 nights) – fort, cafés, some culture before flying out


Traveling mostly with a private driver.

Would love your thoughts. Does this route flow well? Anything you’d swap, skip, or add? Any can’t-miss spots or food tips?

Looking forward to visit this beautiful country!

Below are some of the reasons why I believe I have ADHD.

1. At work, most of the managers I worked with had to repeat the same thing again and again. They also told me that I can’t work independently and make decisions by myself. As a result, I got fired in my last job and almost got fired in two other jobs.

2. My family members repeatedly tell me that I can’t think and do something. Sometimes they question whether I have common sense. It’s mostly similar to what my managers said above.

3. Failure to follow simple instructions/Forgetfulness - For example if my wife tells me to use her credit card for groceries, I’d use the debit card. It happened multiple times, not just once or twice.

4. Lack of clarity about the future - My career is all over the place. Did a bit of finance and then moved to IT. Currently I’m unemployed and even dunno what I’m capable of or good at. I lack confidence 

5. Attention issue - I have a difficulty in paying attention, be it at studies, work or even to what a close family member tells. I think this is the root cause of forgetting, having to repeat the same thing etc.

These are the reasons on top of my head. I seriously feel there’s something wrong with me.

* The park is near Nochchiyagama or Anuradhapura, so maybe I can get a bus/train there first?
* Are there direct buses from Colombo to those towns, and how frequent are they?
* If I take the train, should I go to Anuradhapura and then take a local bus/tuk-tuk to Wilpattu?

1ojckst,Awareness Post for females— A Disturbing Experience Worth Sharing,post,"(refined all wordings  using chatgpt but true experience I heard today)

During a casual conversation, a young woman shared an incident that had happened around 7–8 years ago — something deeply unsettling.

At that time, she had joined a driving school in her hometown to learn driving. During one of her lessons, the instructor had taken her along a quiet, isolated road with no one nearby. While she was driving, he had dropped a pill into a bottle of water, shaken it for a while, and asked her to drink it, saying it was good for her health.

She had refused, but he had continued to insist. He had then started asking personal questions — whether she had a boyfriend, where she lived — and even told her to prove it. Feeling scared and trapped, she had shown him a photo of a strong-looking guy from her neighborhood just to make him stop.

After that incident, the instructor had become cold and strict with her during the rest of the lessons. She had not told her parents immediately because she did not want them to worry, but she had shared it with them after completing the course.

What was alarming was that the same driving school still exists, showing only two 5-star reviews on Google, both from male profiles with no written comments.

This serves as a strong reminder that safety should never be judged by ratings alone.
 It is always better to research thoroughly, read detailed reviews, and avoid being alone with instructors during the first few sessions.

Her refusal to drink from that bottle might have saved her from something terrible. Trusting your instincts can truly make a difference. ⚠️

EDIT:

After a few requests,
Thissera Driving School - ratnapura.
Regretfully the Instructors name wasn't disclosed neither an image available when searched.

Hope it would really help someone to choose driving schools with better safety and verification.

Usually in the beginning of driving lessons instructors anyhow teach in less traffic roads but better safe than sorry!.

The interest is high when the dinners are expensive and the gifts are flowing, but the moment there’s any kind of financial hiccup or suggestion of something less lavish, the dynamic changes instantly. It makes you wonder if they’re even attracted to *you* or just the lifestyle you provide. It’s exhausting to feel like your net worth is your main contribution to the relationship.

The second part is the sheer amount of **emotional playing**. It’s the girls who just seem to be in it for a temporary ego boost or to fill time. They’ll string you along, talk about the future, make you feel like things are real, and then just *poof*—they’re gone. They leave you completely confused and genuinely heartbroken, and they seem totally unaffected by the wreckage they left behind. It’s like a game to them, and they don’t register that they’re dealing with real people with real feelings.

It makes trying to find a genuine, deep connection feel nearly impossible. How are you supposed to vet people when they are so good at pretending? Is true, mutual interest and respect just some fairy tale now, or is it still out there?

What are your stories? How do you guys manage to spot the difference between someone genuinely interested in you and someone who’s just using you for a comfort or a temporary lift?",59,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oja4f1/seriously_is_it_just_me_or_is_dating_getting/,1761757363.0

2.⁠ ⁠Primary Account Surplus: The surplus more than doubled to Rs. 1.4 trillion reflecting improved fiscal balance excluding interest payments.

3.⁠ ⁠Revenue Growth: Total revenue rose 31% year-on-year to Rs. 3.83 trillion, driven mainly by higher VAT and import-related collections.

5.⁠ ⁠Expenditure: Total government spending increased 10% to Rs. 4.3 trillion, mainly due to recurrent expenditure of Rs. 3.8 trillion. Capital spending fell 2% to Rs. 455 billion as interest costs rose to Rs. 1.9 trillion.

6.⁠ ⁠Vehicle Import Taxes: Revenue from vehicle imports soared 818% year-on-year to Rs. 349 billion, up from Rs. 38 billion a year earlier.

However the most recent incident is that one of my cheque got returned and i have not received a call or a email informing the issue, until i call the bank my self to find out. It was just a simple error in date. Have to call the branch and the head office and the branch again to get a picture of the cheque.

I don’t see a reason of paying extra charges when they cannot provide an adequate service to protect our funds. What should i do and what is the best bank to maintain a current account in Sri Lanka.

1oixism,Not becoming a doctor in this country might honestly be a blessing in disguise,post,"I mean no disrespect to anyone in medicine; it’s a noble path, but people really underestimate just how stupid  it is. You spend about 5 years buried in textbooks, and just when you think you’re done, you start your internship. That’s when reality hits. You’re suddenly working 24-hour shifts, barely sleeping, handling endless patients. By the end of the first month you’re drained, by three months you’re basically a zombie in a lab coat.

Then comes the post-intern phase, which can last another 2–4 years. You don’t even get to pick where you go; your posting depends on your rank. So you might end up in some far-off hospital, hoping there’s clean water and no wildlife in the area. The system grinds you down completely; physically, mentally, emotionally. All in the name of “respect”.

And the worst part? You can’t even complain. The moment you do, people say things like, *“Well, no one forced you to become a doctor.”* As if that somehow justifies how badly the system treats you.

When I was small, I used to wonder why doctors always seemed pissed off at everything;  short-tempered, distant, tired. Now that I’ve grown up, I completely get it. After going through what they go through, it would be strange **not** to be angry.

So yeah, if you’re in another field, you might not realize it yet, but you’ve probably dodged a bullet. You may not have a fancy title, but at least you’ll have time, peace, and sanity; and in this country, that’s worth a lot more.

BTW, everything in this post is completely true, not a single part has been exaggerated; wildlife, drinking water, 24 hr shifts, everything. If you get the chance, speak to a doctor thats recently graduated and ask them how proud they are of their life decisions.

It’s not that I have zero knowledge about the field, I’ve gained some basic understanding of the job flow through my own research and observations. However, I strongly believe that true insight comes from those with real experience. That’s why I’m reaching out to professionals already working in this industry for guidance and advice. I only have a few questions..

First, How does one progress through the ranks of the four marine engineer positions (4th, 3rd, 2nd, and Chief Engineer)? How long does it typically take to climb to the top, and what are the approximate salary ranges for each stage? 

Second, What can a newcomer or trainee expect to earn at the entry level?

Third, Are there on-shore jobs in this field that offer a similar wage range to sea-based roles?

It'll be silly of me to ask whether this field is challenging, given the demanding nature of sea life and the workload on large commercial vessels, so there won’t be a fourth. Thanks in advance to anyone who willing to share their experiences and insights, your guidance would mean a lot as I prepare to take my first steps into this exciting career path.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oif69r/about_job_opportunities_and_salaries_of_naval/,1761671334.0

My main question is.

Does any ISP in Sri Lanka, either residential or business, actually provide a formal uptime guarantee or Service Level Agreement (SLA) that clearly defines something like “99.x% availability”?

Also, does anyone have a reliable contact at SLT who genuinely handles customer service issues?

Calling 1212 is pointless, the support is completely passive and unhelpful. There is no escalation point

Even the branch manager doesn’t apologize or take ownership when things go wrong.

It scans the official CSE announcements and filters only the **cash dividend-related** ones, with record dates, XD dates, and payment details all in one clean table.

No ads, no logins, just quick info for investors.

So I was scrolling through Reddit and saw this post where a dude said he refuses to give his kids both his and his wife’s last name cause Im the provider.. so they take my name. 💀 Bro...what century are we in?

Like okay, I get tradition ...... last names and all that..... but itz wild how people still see that as a symbol of dominance or ownership. The whole .....I provide so I own........mentality just screams patriarchy in surround sound.

And heres the thing ......feminism isnt about hating men or thinking women are better. Its literally just about choice. A woman should be able to be whatever she wants ...a housewife.... a CEO....a mechanic....a researcher.....or none of the above...... because she chooses it...not because society boxed her into a.....role.

But ngl....Ive met quite a few Sri Lankan guys who have this completely twisted idea of feminism. Like.. they hear the word and immediately go ...ugh....feminist = man hater.. No bro.... we re just tired of double standards...

So yeah... Im curious..... what do SL men actually think about feminism????
Do you see it as something necessary or something threatening????
And if you re against it.....why exactly???? Genuinely asking....... not trying to start a war here.


EDIT: Thanks for all the honest replies. I’ve gotta say, there really are good guys out there who believe in equality and mutual respect .... the ones who don’t feel the need to control women but just think everyone should be recognized for their skills, not their gender. That’s the energy we need more of.

And to the women reading this, do your thing. Whatever path you choose, own it. Sri Lanka’s still got a long way to go but honestly, we’re not completely trapped in those old school boxes anymore.
If you’re stuck somewhere toxic, please leave. Do whatever you have to do to build the life you want ....you only get one shot at it.

Also, this goes both ways. Some women treat men like competition and that’s not it either. At the end of the day, it’s not a battle of who’s better .... feminism isn’t about hating men, it’s about everyone getting treated equally.

And as for the dudes still stuck in the ""I’m the leader, women obey"" era ..... seriously, educate yourselves. The world’s moving on without you. Don’t let your kids grow up thinking their dad’s mindset expired in 2025.

1ohq6qd,Is charitha attalage's New Music Video Yogeshwari Borrowing Twenty One Pilots’ Puzzle-Style Rollout?,post,"Hey everyone — I’m curious to get your thoughts on this:

You know how Twenty One Pilots build these whole teaser/puzzle-universes around their album releases? For example:

Ahead of their album Trench (2018) they dropped cryptic URLs, billboards, visuals tied to their world of “Dema”, characters like Clancy, etc. 

Their album Clancy (2024) also came with a visual album, hints via social posts and what was described as “each song has an accompanying music video” and a narrative arc. 

On their latest album Breach (2025) they again leaned into this: announcing with “cryptic clues and Easter eggs” leading up to the release. 


So: They pretty much invented a kind of “interactive mystery/universe” around their music drops — involving fans decoding, researching, digging into hidden details.

My question to the community:
I’ve just watched charitha attalage ’s new music video and I got strong vibes that it might be closely mirroring the method of Twenty One Pilots i.e., the visuals, teaser-style cryptic imagery, maybe even narrative worldbuilding. On one hand: I like the artistry. On the other: is it just a homage, or is it so close that it feels like a copy?

Has anyone else noticed this resemblance (to TØP’s style)?

Do you think charitha attalage is consciously borrowing from Twenty One Pilots, or is it coincidental / part of broader trends in music video storytelling?

If you’re familiar with Twenty One Pilots’ puzzle/teaser approach, which parts stand out most (for comparison) in charitha’s video?

Finally: is this kind of strategy (teaser-universe + hidden clues) good for the music-video medium? Or does it risk being derivative if too many people copy it?

Would love to hear your takes.

1ohozs6,Is Dhammika Perera monopolizing and manipulating capital market of Sri Lanka?,post,"Guys what the hell is going on with Dhammika Perera these days. There are so many news about him buying and selling off shares. Perhaps it seems most of them are direct towards a single goal which is unclear to the general public.

These actions are mostly taken in banking sector whereas he sold off shares of Commercial bank and Seylan bank. Now his key bankers are Sampath Bank and Pan Asia bank.

Again there's a news ongoing about, buying shares of Harischandra Mills and expanding Hayleys to the Super Market sector. Hayleys coming to the retail sector is a major transformation though seems bit off hence they mostly deal with wholesale B2B sectors. This might be a set back for Keells and Cargills because of their dependency of Hayleys products.

1ohf7vz,Buying an apartment for 1st time,post,"From the time I began to save any money, I had always put it in banks. Now, I have begun to realize that money in bank essentially means I am losing money in the long run, what with inflation and all. 
Hence, I have decided to take the plunge by investing in a 2 person apartment (I am not keen to invest in land. That’s a Hard No)
The thing is my total savings comes to around only 10-15Mn approximately. If absolutely required, I am willing to take a loan for a max of 5Mn.


My goal: Rent it out for the initial few years. Therefore, make a call on whether to sell it based on how much the value has appreciated.

Since I am new to this, there are few questions that are bugging me. 
Would also welcome any additional pointers. 

1) What’s the best course of action for me and how can I best get started?
2) Should I go for a brand new or older apartment (If so, how old is too old?)
How will this affect my ability to rent it out or sell it eventually?
3) How I can best search for most ideal apartments to buy? Who should I reach out to?
I’m trying to avoid any brokers, but is Ikman along enough?

1ohdx7w,Terminated without final salary. how can I recover my pay in Sri Lanka?,post,"I was appointed to manage a new company that was about to start operations in Sri Lanka. The company itself was not registered yet, and the owner (my boss) lives in the UK.

The office was located inside the investor company’s premises, and I received my salary directly from that investor into my bank account for four months.

In September, my boss sent a foreign person to supervise the work. At the end of that month, I was informed that my boss no longer required my services so basically, I was terminated.

The termination itself is not an issue for me. I don’t wish to work with them again after this dispute. My only concern is that I haven’t received my salary for September, even though I worked the full month.

When I contacted my boss (who’s in the UK), he refused to respond. When I asked the investor company, they said the boss told them not to pay my final month’s salary, so they won’t release it.

I gave my full effort and completed all my work properly. Now I’m stuck because the company isn’t officially registered, and both the boss and the investor are refusing to pay me.

What are my options to recover my salary in Sri Lanka quickly and with minimal cost? Are there any labour authorities, arbitration centres, or free complaint channels that can handle this kind of issue? Any guidance would really help.

I’m planning to buy a **Yamaha MT-15 V2 (2025)** brand new.  
I’ve been checking with a few places and most of them said the **price is around 1.5 million**. They ask for 50,000 LKR for the preorder and another 450,000 LKR once the bike arrives, so about 500,000 LKR down payment in total. Then, it’s around 30,000 LKR per month for 5 years.

My problem is, I’m struggling to find a **genuine place** to buy from here in Sri Lanka.  
So if anyone here has experience or knows a **trustworthy dealer**, please drop your recommendations  
it would mean a lot 🙏

A bit about me I'm 23M and I’m from Colombo 12 and I work in Townhall, so my daily travel is just about 2.5 km each way. On weekends, I go to Dehiwala for my university classes. I don’t really go on long rides, it’s mostly short daily travel. (My knowledge about bikes is kinda poor)

**I used to own a Pulsar 135 (second-hand)** before, but **that bike was always in the garage**. It gave me more problems than peace, and honestly, that experience made me **hate bikes for a long time** 😅

But this time, I’ve been **saving up for a long time** because I want **something New, reliable and long-lasting**. So this is a **big decision** for me.

Would really **appreciate some honest advice** from anyone who’s familiar with the MT-15 or with buying brand new bikes in Sri Lanka. 🙏  
Thanks a lot in advance, my Sri Lankan bros ❤️

1ogvw83,Help! Visiting your beautiful country for 3 weeks!,post,"Hi everyone!

My girlfriend and I will visit Sri Lanka from the 8th until the 28th of November. We are trying to make a conceptual travel plan, but like to stay flexible. I was hoping you guys would like to help me out with some things.

\- At first we figured we would start at Colombo for 2 days. However, online we noticed a lot of people advice Negombo. Can anyone tell me what the pros and cons are of both? Are plan is to travel to central Sri Lanka and then move to south and travel back around the coast while we relax and surf.

\- We are looking to travel from Colombo/Negombo to Sigiriya → Kandy → Ella → Udawalawe → Tangalle → Mirissa → Colombo/Negombo. Are we missing any amazing places with this route or are there any amazing places close to one of those above that we should definitely pay a visit? We love nature, animals and locals the most. We don't enjoy temples and statues as much and we are not looking for nightlife (party, etc.).

\- Also, are there places you'd recommend staying just 2 nights or maybe longer and if so, can you explain why?

\- We want to visit a National Park and ChatGPT advised us to go to Udawalawe National Park since it's close to our travel route, not too busy and good during november. Are second option would be Wilpattu National Park. We love to see wild animals but we've seen elephants already so preferably bears, crocodiles, leopards, monkeys and such. We love birds too, but it's not a gamechanger for us. Are we good with the Udawalawe National Park?

\- We would also like to follow a cooking class. Any recommendations where and maybe even with which provider? Any other activity we should really do that I haven't mentioned?

\- We plan on doing a train ride as well. From Kandy to Ella seems to be the most famous one. Does it matter that much and if not, what other parts can you recommend?

\- We also plan on renting a TukTuk for a big part of our travel. Since apparantly from Colombo/Negombo to Sigiriya is quite far we might do it after our train ride and travel with the TukTuk back across the coast to Colombo/Negombo. We are travelling with 2 suitcases though, not backpacks. Is there enough room for two suitcases in the back or is a TukTuk a no-go for us?

\- Lastly, do you have any tips and tricks we should do or know about or things we should definitely avoid?

Thanks in advance for the time you took to read my post and maybe even reply. I appreciate your comments. I've Googled most of it (or asked ChatGPT), but I feel like you, the Sri Lankan people, or the active Sri Lanka travelers, know best. Have a good day!

What kind of companies and industries should you target for? How do you make connections and get a good name within your company and get promotions to climb the ladder? What is company culture and does drama brew between colleagues everyday or in events?

Do people usually change jobs every 3-5 years to get a salary bump? How do you earn the Big Bucks?

Also what kind of skills and experience along with qualifications do you need to be employable abroad incase you need to make a move? Is there anything I missed or need to know?

1ogpmqs,ISP rant (hutch cliq packages),post,"
As we all know, the Hutch Cliq packages are some of the best bang-for-your-buck cellular internet options in Sri Lanka, with the 30-day, 60GB FUP plan being the most popular. I've used Cliq since it was under Etisalat, and it has been a reliable package with decent speeds.

When Hutch first introduced it with new 4G speeds, the service was consistently good throughout the day. Download speeds were decent enough until the FUP kicked in, and I had no complaints. Peak hours were slow, but that was always to be expected.

Lately, however, I can't help but think the package has become nearly unusable for anything beyond basic browsing—even with good signal strength. At my house, I get the full Cliq speed of 20Mbps (the cap for these packages) at all times except during peak hours, when it drops to around 3-10Mbps. For comparison, non-Cliq speeds on the same network reach up to 60Mbps during off-peak hours and 35Mbps during peak hours, which is amazing.

But the real-world experience, before hitting the FUP, tells a different story:

· YouTube constantly buffers, even at 360p/480p at times.
· Downloads are always capped at 200-300 KB/s, despite full signal and speed tests showing 20Mbps. I only get the full speeds (around 2 MB/s) between 12-7 AM. Torrents are even worse, at 100-200 KB/s.
· Video conferencing lags, stutters, and buffers.
· Streaming anything is a buffering hell from start to finish. 1080p is only possible during the off-peak hours mentioned, with Netflix being the sole exception.

Let's say we could manage all that; the absolute worst part, however, is the connectivity. I feel like ever since the day Hutch had that island-wide outage, the connectivity has been really poor, with CONSTANT disconnections every 3-5 minutes. You end up having to toggle airplane mode or switch mobile data on and off to restore decent speeds or connectivity. I've tested this on multiple phones, and the connectivity issues persist.

The result is that conferences get cut off or become laggy and blurry, you can't watch a video or stream in peace, downloads get corrupted or are suddenly throttled mid-download, and gaming suffers from extreme latency paired with these disconnections. Basically, the only thing this package is good for right now is browsing—and even social media buffers.

Everyone in my family uses Cliq separately, but I've been thinking of switching to the Fiber Flash 10 unlimited package, which will undoubtedly be better while still fitting my budget.

Regardless the pros and cons of giving child a phone, Do you think the government has the right to manipulate our daily life? This is more like CCP giving  their citizen orders about how to live. I bet SL will go from democratic republic to communist republic in some more days. Anyway lets hope for the best!

**EDIT**\- For the people who says this is an good idea... yes it may be, then children might have time to touch some grass and connect with the nature. But completely alienating the child from technology is too much. If your child consuming too much brain rot videos its their parents responsibility to control what the child see (that's why **parental controls** exist) not the government. The government itself says that they should be advanced by technology, but how you should expect that when your future generations don't see any inspiration from technological aspect.

The whole negative thing started with the wrong use of parents, of mobile phones on their child without proper supervision  
example- ""Lamayata bat tika kawanna lesi phone eka athata dunnama""  
Anyway in such times also its parents responsibility to make your child see proper content which can help to to stimulate their thirst for knowledge

Please note that I'm a 22 year old and have no experience in having a child. This is all what I conceive from my day today experience, Hence I may be wrong in some aspects",97,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ogpe4q/govt_plans_mobile_phone_ban_for_children_below_12/,1761497118.0

1ogmsur,Education and infrastructure for the estate sector,post,"Guys has anyone noticed how despite the cities progressing at a rapid state, outside cities are basically 20 years in the past?

Their schools are very basic if nothing at all, some places don’t have access to electricity, no bus stop. The majority of people there drop out after O-levels to work somewhere or run a tuk. 

This is especially true for the central estate sector, for a group that pretty much carries the country on their back with tea and various other exports they’re basically treated like cattle. 

They live in line rooms (you need to see a line room in person to understand how bad it is) and each school is several kilometers from home with freezing weather and rain, most don’t do their A-levels, males start working at the estate after O-levels and females either get married early or start estate or tea plucking work early, they have children and the same cycle continues. 

Some of them don’t even have NIC cards or identity documents 

But if you look at the estate owners and managers they’re rich to the point it’s like royalty and peasants. The city municipal councils there have some of the largest budgets you can imagine. 

Despite every govt including the current one promising change it’s usually a maximum of a daily wage increase and that’s it. This govt has representation from the estate sector also. 

At some point estate workers invited the govt MPs or president to come tour their living conditions, see their line rooms etc but so far no one’s cared enough to make significant change.

1oggk1h,CIMA vs MBA for a Cybersecurity Graduate Working in DevOps (Looking to Move Toward Management & Consulting),post,"Hey everyone 👋

I graduated last month with a degree in Cybersecurity, and I’m currently working full time remotely for a foreign company in the DevOps field. The pay is decent, so money isn’t really the issue, my main focus right now is moving up the career ladder and preparing for the future.

Here’s a bit of background:
After my A-Levels, I actually started CIMA because I’ve always had an interest in the business side of things. I only completed the Certificate Level, then started my degree.

Now that I’m working full-time, I’m trying to decide whether I should continue CIMA or instead go for an MBA. My long-term goal is to move into consulting, project management, and IT-business management roles, not just stay on the purely technical side.

I also have some business ideas that I plan to work on in the near future, so gaining solid business and management knowledge would really help.

So my question is:
1. Would it be better to complete CIMA fully or go for an MBA?
2. Or are there any other professional or practical qualifications that would add more value to my skills and goals?

For context, I plan to move abroad in about 2–3 years, so I want to build a good foundation before that.

Would love to hear your thoughts and recommendations 🙏

I am thinking to have a 1 night 2 days itinerary and it would be nice if the guide has the tent facilities etc. (I do not mean glamping, but just a portable tent where I do not have to separately borrow from someone else).

Do you know a guide like that or let me know if there is a way to find such guide? Because so many guides are only chasing foreign tourists nowadays and the real local guides are not promoting them on internet.

The ship, after a quick check on live vessel tracking, turned out to be OOCL Atlanta, en route to Singapore

But the second object, the one that looked like a rocket or missile coming from the southwest and disappearing toward the northeast, still remains a mystery. I searched multiple live rocket launch trackers, yet found no scheduled launches that match the timing or trajectory.

Captured both, one ordinary, one extraordinary.

Moments like these remind me how much is still happening above and around us that we don't always understand.

If anyone has insights into unscheduled launches, test flights, or re-entry events visible from Sri Lanka around 6:58-7:05 AM today, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I’m a laid-back, social traveller (think: scooters, sunsets, small beach bars, hostel meetups—not into super-club/EDM nights).

**About me / vibe**

* UK-based, here to meet new people, make new friends and create amazing memories!
* **Advanced Open Water** diver — keen on a relaxed **2-tank day** around **Unawatuna/Galle (Orestes/Rangoon?)** or **Hikkaduwa** reefs.
* Daytime goals: **Galle Fort** wander, **Handunugoda tea estate**, **Coconut Tree Hill / Secret Beach**, maybe **Kanneliya/Sinharaja** for a rainforest fix, **Dondra Lighthouse**, and a mellow **sunset bar** run.
* Evenings: hostel socials, open-mics/rooftops, low-key beach bars.

**Draft plan (flexible):**

* **Dec 21–23:** Weligama (likely **Spindrift** / **Hangtime**) to meet people.
* **Dec 23–25:** Hikkaduwa for a change of scene (Narigama area).
* **Dec 26–29:** Back around Weligama/Ahangama (scooter loops, maybe Doctor’s House one evening).
* **Dec 30–Jan 2:** **Mirissa** for a chilled **NYE on the beach** (small venue/wristband over big clubs).
* **Jan 3:** Back to CMB.

**Looking for:**

* Recommendations for **social hostels** (dorm *or* private) where you’ve actually met people.
* Pointers to **active WhatsApp/Telegram meetups** in Weligama/Ahangama/Mirissa (volleyball, open-mics, scooter convoys, dive buddy groups).
* Recent tips on **diving operators** doing good multi-dive deals and which sites are best in late December.

We’re open to any part of the island, coastal or inland, as long as it’s safe, comfortable, and has that “kid heaven” vibe. It could be a family resort, a hotel with great kids facilities, or even a family-friendly town where there are play areas and other children to meet.

I am 23 yo now. First did my A'Ls in 2021 and failed it and then I Gave it up.So I've been living as kind of a faliure since then.
I started doing a course at VTA and it didn't go well. Anyways I completed it (1 year draughtsman course) and somehow I Started doing A'Ls again in the middle of 2023.
I did maths with ICT for 2024 A'L and now I have the oopportunity to follow this MIT course in uok.

I am not sure what to do anymore. I was interested in software engineering at some point but that interest is gone now. Also I find that working in IT is too stressful for me.(But I can handle it if I have to.)  Kinda feel like I wanna switch to another field but it seems hard now.
In other hand, my parents are too old, I have to take the responsibility of the family (I am the only boy in familly)

What to do now?
Is it possible to find a good job and earn first, then follow an external part time degree while working so I can manage the expenses.. Should I follow that MIT degree at anycost?
Doing part time jobs while following the MIT course would be a solution ?
Or how can I switch field?
I am also interested in business,accounting..

Any advice is appreciated. :)

Also I am grateful If there is any job opportunity too. Sorry If I am asking for too much but, If you are a business owner , Is there any chance that I can work and learn under your guidance ?

I recently saw a few posts and discussions asking whether Sri Lanka actually has oil and gas reserves. I stumbled upon this U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Fact Sheet (2025-3043) published in 2024, and thought it might be useful to share here.

The report estimates about 1 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable conventional oil and over 53 trillion cubic feet of gas in the India + Sri Lanka region, mainly covering the Mannar and Cauvery Basins.

It doesn’t mean we already have commercially viable reserves - but it does show there’s recognized potential under our offshore territory.

Honestly, if Sri Lanka ever develops recoverable oil or gas, I hope we follow the Norwegian model and build something like a sovereign wealth fund to invest in long-term national development - rather than turning it into short-term subsidies or populist giveaways.

1of7gt3,Sri Lanka sitting on billion Dollors $ of mineral mining proposals,post,"Sri Lanka sitting on billion dollars of mineral mining proposals 

ECONOMYNEXT – Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment has seen strong investor interest in mineral mining with 14 proposals worth billion dollars coming into the agency, Chairman Arjuna Herath said.

Investors were awaiting a policy framework from the government.

“So, that policy formulation is happening at this moment,” Herath said. “Minerals would be another sector and industry that really will drive our investments in the country and, economic development in this country.”

Sri Lanka is seeing investor inquiries and stronger interest from foreign investors as the country recovers from default and they see political and economic stability, he said.

Sri Lanka has mineral sands which are now exported in raw and various graded forms with royalties at the exported prices and some complex value addition requirements.

Sri Lanka mineral industry kept down by unusual export value added tax

Australia keen to invest in Sri Lanka phosphate, graphite, ilmenite sectors: High Commissioner

Local mining firms have said in the past the royalties are far higher than countries like Australia and mining licenses are too short term, deterring investors.

Mining licenses in successful countries are given for 10 to 15 years, industry officials have said.

Areas like graphite were among the first minerals that were exported by indigenous entrepreneurs during British rule but they were later expropriated.

I'm from Europe and I'd like to confirm a few things. I plan to visit your beautiful country again soon, but this time, I want to explore it from the cabin of a tuk-tuk.

I'm well aware of the risks involved — I’ve spent a lot of time riding a motorcycle in India. I don’t underestimate the risks, but I don’t overestimate them either.

So, could you help me with a few details?

* There are rumors that, after recent incidents, it's no longer legal to obtain a driving license for a three-wheeler, for me, as a foreigner. I tried asking ChatGPT and searched Google, of course. I’m pretty sure that’s nonsense, but I’d like to confirm it.
* What’s the usual price for renting this kind of vehicle for one month? Also, what about the cost of insurance and a local permit? Just approximate numbers — for someone like me, a visitor (and a guest 😉).
* Can you recommend a decent agency that offers this kind of service? I already know the big names, but maybe there’s a hidden gem you could suggest.
* And, last but not least, Is there anything else I should consider that I haven’t mentioned?

I wanted to ask those who are working in the IT industry or doing recruitment in Sri Lanka. What kind of CV are companies really expecting these days?

Back in 2024, I applied for Senior Software Engineer roles at 4 companies using a CV that included my photo. I got interview calls from 3 of them and ended up with multiple offers.

This year (2025), I changed my resume to an ATS-friendly format without a photo, just a clean simple layout. But I haven’t received any calls so far, even though I’m applying for similar positions.

So I’m wondering:

* Have most local companies started using ATS systems now?
* Do recruiters here still prefer photo CVs?
* Or am I missing something important with my new format or content?

Would love to hear what’s actually working for others who are job hunting or hiring in the Sri Lankan IT scene.

I recently got selected as a **Software Engineering intern** at a startup**.** They asked me to do simple task which I’m excited about it’s a good opportunity to show my skills.

Nobody gives a straight answer about when we’ll actually get it.

They’ve been like this from the very start. We saw all the red flags but still went ahead with the order. Customers are constantly coming in and creating a scene because nobody takes any accountability. I’m honestly baffled that the management hasn’t fixed their operations. It’s shocking that a company can run like this and still survive.

They have *no* customer service whatsoever. No updates, no urgency, no care. I’m beyond frustrated at this point.

It’s honestly ridiculous. Even the managers don’t even answer their phones. Nobody seems to take any responsibility — it’s like they just don’t care. They know we have no choice but to sit and wait while they drag things out at their own pace.

There are so many others in the same situation, all stuck dealing with the same nonsense. Even the guy who handled our case doesn’t care anymore probably because he’s already got his commission. Every day it’s the same story: “It didn’t come,” “It’s not on the list,” It’s exhausting.

There’s absolutely nobody we can push this to. It’s so frustrating that we’re spending all this money and getting treated like this.

First phase over 2 years the elimination of bottles. Return to glass with a refund system.  Standardise all bottles into distinct sizes.

Takeaways, return to a system of tiffin boxes or similar. Or one use paper boxes which incur an extra charge.

Supermarkets everyone purchases a one time large cloth bag that they keep and take around when they do their shopping.

Ban single use forks and knives and spoons. This will result in far less waste and a better looking clean environment.

I say this because there's a really old woman that my mom got as a maid from a neighbor and she looks so old and frail but works so hard and for the whole day. Apparently she charges only 1000 for a day's work but that's obviously slave labor and I told my mom to give her at least 2k and food which is still not enough in my opinion. And there's many others who are old but have been working their whole life and earn their money respectfully. So it boils my blood to see perfectly healthy people choosing to be lazy and beg.

1oe54v8,Newbie to this Society and Stucked,post,"First of all sorry for my imperfect English. I’m currently working in a government It firm while doing my studies. I feel like so broke and empty from inside. A few days ago my supervisor got a meeting for all of us and said this “if you really wanna go up in the corporate ladder, you might sell your soul” and it hit me hard. 

Those executives are living for working. They don’t have any other life except their work related things. And they expect the same from us. I enjoy foods, musics but I need money for that. That’s why I’m working. Most of my co-workers doing bullshit. They aren’t actually working and so freaking unproductive. They spent like 2hrs just for the lunch. At 12.30 they go out to grab their lunch and eat until 2pm. And take another 30min for sanitary needs. Im not joking. Because of this unproductiveness we all the team have to do work even after we came home. 

This is the best thing, when I first came there I realized the working environment and the mental health is so good and not like what social media says - because they are working so freely. But couple of weeks after I realized they are actually doing nothing lol. 

Another thing the difference between co-workers and friends. I’m originally from A/pura and I had few good friends. Now I lost them because I don’t meet them regularly and they are doing their A/l for the third time. But I met some good guys in my office - they are good if every other thing good but if some bad happened they are all gone. They are pretending like good but they all are acting. I’m not saying they are wrong maybe that’s the best thing you can do to survive in your workplace. But anyway now I don’t have anyone to do any serious conversation. Kinda sad about that

And I feel like this. These corporate people are brainwashed to work their whole life or they actually can’t escape this cycle. I believe there are more peeps have more experiences than me in this sub. Give me your honest opinion about this. Because I can’t discuss about any of this with my mom and dad, they are getting upset so quickly.

1ioov8p,The Reality of Being a Cashier in Sri Lanka,post,"never thought I’d be writing something like this, but I feel like it’s time to speak up about the toxic work environment I’ve been enduring at Keells

I was hired as a cashier, but the job description barely scratches the surface of what I actually do. On paper, it’s a cashier role but in reality, it’s so much more and not in a good way. I work at least 3 days a week for 16 hours, and the rest of the week is 10-12 hour shifts. My basic salary is 21,000 LKR, and the rest is overtime. But here’s the kicker: I had to work **78 hours of overtime** just to earned 37000  **LKR**.  Let that sink in.

The workload is overwhelming. As cashiers, we’re expected to do tasks that have nothing to do with our role. We cut and wrap pumpkins, arrange vegetables, track expired goods in the dry department, Forwarding, Cleaning, check expiration dates on dairy, eggs, bread, and more. We even cut and wrap bread, sell green bags, and push Nexus loyalty cards with a *target* hanging over our heads. If we don’t meet these targets, we’re scolded. also some customers treat us like literal garbage,

And  promotional items we’re forced to sell. If we don’t meet those expectations, it feels like the end of the world. we can't force customers to buy those things

The physical and mental toll is exhausting. There are days when I can’t even drink water or eat properly of standin . Breakfast at 10 AM, lunch at 3 or 4 PM, and dinner at 9 PM this is my daily routine. We’re not allowed to sit, even for a moment, and by the end of the day, we’re completely drained exhauseted.

We close the outlet at 11:30 PM, get boarding place by 1 AM, and are back at work by 7 AM. This isn’t  fair, and it’s not humane.

To the management Please start valuing your employees. Pay us fairly. Treat us with respect. We’re not machines we’re human beings with limits. It’s time to rethink how you’re running this place because the current system is breaking us.

I stayed for 2,5 week and my trip went to;
Unawatuna for 1 night
Udawalawe for 2 nights
Ella for 2 nights
Kandy for 2 nights
Unawatuna for 8 nights

What did I do?
- Visited Udawalawe national park, transit home, relaxed at one of the most amazing accomodations I ever stayed (https://www.booking.com/Share-3l4miY)
- Enjoyed the lush green mountains in Ella, rented a scooter and visited the 9 arch bridge, climbed little adams peak, climbed Ella rock, had the best dinner at the Clay Pot, took the train to Kandy
- Spoiled myself with a 5 star hotel with infinity pool and amazing views, visited some silk shops, visited the Buddha temple and met the highest monk of Kandy, walked around the lake
- Had an amazing 8 days stay with my auntie from Sydney, went for regular massages, had great dinners, visited Galle and the fort, rented a scooter and went surfing every morning

Dislikes;
The pollution is crazy really bad, same goes for trash and rubbish in the nature, I wish (local) people would take more care of that but I understand it's a money issue, sad to see so many stray dogs, sad to see animal abuse from time to time. I sincerely hope it will get better. 

Overall;
Loved the country, the people seem genuine and nice and are very helpful and kind, the nature is insanely beautiful, most beautiful Asian country I have visited, top 3 country overall I visited (and I am well traveled) I think Ella was my highlight, but a shame to see that green mountains are being cut to build more accomodations. I really hope everyone will try and take care of this beautiful country. Oh and I was really impressed with how well the roads are 😅😂

The past few days have been incredibly stressful for me, and as I was finally trying to wind down, my 6yo daughter handed me a small folded piece of paper. Inside, she had drawn a flag. Her teacher had asked the class to draw their respective country flags, and I was speechless at how much of it she managed to remember and recreate from memory.

As an overseas Sri Lankan, I find myself missing home almost all the time. My daughter, though, has barely lived in Sri Lanka, and I often carry a quiet guilt for keeping her away from her roots. Yet, this simple drawing gave me hope. She’s already speaking Tamil, and now she’s slowly beginning to pick up some Sinhala words too.

For the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe.. just maybe.. I haven’t lost that connection for her. Maybe she’ll carry a piece of Sri Lanka with her after all.

This was supposed to be a sacred event, something beautiful and respectful. But what we’ve ended up with is total chaos. One grandma was literally sitting in the middle of the street near Trinity and shitting like it was a totally normal thing to do💩 The whole Gohagoda and Wewa Rawuma areas smell like pee. Seriously can we have just a little discipline?

Look, I get it. People had to stay in long queues for days. It’s tough. But that doesn’t excuse this level of damage.

And the sad part? Almost Fifty taps that were donated by kind souls to give free water to pilgrims were stolen. Like, wow 😂What kind of gratitude is that?

Some people even started begging, and when they didn’t get anything, they began threatening people. The whole organization has loopholes too, I’m not denying that. But our people have this habit of blaming everything on the government and never once thinking about their own behavior right?

Now, schools are reopening next week, and before that happens, we, the locals, will have to clean up this mess; again. Because if we don’t, kids will be exposed to serious health issues. 😑

Yes, the damage is done. But as always, Kandy will rise again with her beauty. We will clean our city, and yeah, we’ll remember the “gratitude”of you “forever”. 🙏 Nibbana is so far away for everyone who ruined this place 😔 Tysm",676,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k6jeb4,1745468237.0
1kcjil2,Homeless Sri Lankan uni student featured in BBC show,post,"Just came across a clip from a BBC medical reality show featuring a Sri Lankan student who was forced into homelessness after being unable to pay his university tuition.

It’s not shown in this clip, but thankfully he now has a job and a roof over his head.

I’m sharing this for visibility to identify the university involved so it can be held accountable, and to warn prospective students from South Asia to exercise caution. As many have pointed out in the comments, UK universities are supposed to offer emergency housing and financial support for students in crisis. I live in the UK and can guarantee this kind of treatment would be unthinkable for students from Europe or even China/Hong Kong - it’s a disturbing example of how individuals from the Global South can be uniquely vulnerable and overlooked.

I’m honestly at a loss for words at the level of exploitation and neglect this student faced from the university, Home Office etc. The only comfort was seeing the paramedics treat him with the dignity and compassion he deserved from the start.

1l1pup0,"Genuinely asking, what exactly are we celebrating here?",post,"So I just saw this clip of Anudi Gunasekara arriving back in Sri Lanka, and I’m genuinely trying to understand why the country is treating her like she just came back from winning Miss World, climbing Everest, and defeating Thanos, all on the same day. 

And in case this fever dream wasn’t extra enough, News First straight-up called her “Sri Lanka’s Queen.” Like… respectfully, did we hold a coronation I missed? 

Please, for the love of nuance, don’t hit me with the tired “you’re just jealous” line. Be more creative. There are people, doctors, researchers, teachers, athletes, even literal children doing 10x more for this country every day without getting even 1% of this attention.

This isn’t about hating her, it’s about questioning why this is *news,* why we reward pageantry over substance, and why we’re so desperate to pretend we won something when we didn’t. Meanwhile, people who do real, measurable good for this country go unnoticed.

The issue isn’t her. It’s this bizarre national obsession with looking important instead of doing anything important. This is why we lose. We glorify aesthetics. We put effort into image over substance. We hand out grand welcomes for participation while quietly ignoring people who actually build, serve, or change anything.

Again, nothing against her personally. But as a country, can we at least ask ourselves why this is the moment we chose to celebrate at this scale?

Would love to hear actual perspectives, because right now it just feels like we're all cosplaying national excellence.

1kbkuqr,Suicide at Sabragamuwa Uni,post,"A 2nd year student, *Charith Dilshan* of Sabragamuwa university has committed suicide yesterday due to ragging by seniors. Reportedly he was stripped naked by them and he decided that he doesn't want to suffer humiliation any further.

To my knowledge, the news is being intentionally suppressed by other students who have instructed others to not mention suicide or his name in public. Hostel students (first year) have been (possibly unofficially) instructed to go back home if possible. It has been one whole day since his suicide and there has been barely any reporting on it as far as I see. This should be headlines everywhere but it is not. Therefore I'm posting this here to get this news to more people in hopes of getting it out there.

If you're from the university or know more about this incident, please feel free to contribute under this to not let this news go hidden. If there are corrections or additions, I will edit the post or post it under here. 

Edit 01: Image of the deceased student from the poster shared by the faculty [IMG-20250430-WA0010.jpg](https://postimg.cc/FkSsBz8C)

Edit 02: ""Okay so as much as I've heard what had happened was the reason why he was brutally bullied was because he went to washroom while wearing shorts in the hostel,which is apparently forbidden for First and Second Year Students. The Tech Faculty has always been really brutal in terms of bullying but yes it's being said that the major reason why he's bullied and locked up in a locker/some cupboard is because of the fact that he wore shorts to use the restroom in the hostel."" from u/Prestigious_Cut_458

Edit 03' ""Oh gosh. I went to Sabra. This wasn’t the first time in Sabra. 
I’m so tired of the ragging culture in local universities. I was in the English Lit dept. and because some of us refused to participate in the bulling they disguised as bonding activities we were ostracised and were called ‘Ala’ 
I’m so sorry for this child. This is murder in my eyes. I hope justice will be served.

Edit 07: MoE has issued a [media release about the incident](https://www.newswire.lk/2025/05/01/university-student-death-linked-to-ragging-govt-announces-probe/) and announced a probe to investigate and requested the public to refrain from sharing unverified personal information which could harm people.

1o8pqg0,"I’m 25, earning 550k a month without a degree or diploma",post,"I’m not posting this to flex or make anyone feel bad. I know there are people here who feel stuck. Some older than me, some younger. I have been there too.

I’m 25 now, heading a department for a company. I earn around 550,000 LKR a month. It is a non-tech role. No degree and no diploma. My highest qualification is O/Ls with 2 As. I even failed my A/Ls with only one A in English.

I started working when I was 19. I lost two important people in my family before I turned 23. That changed everything because I became the only breadwinner. It forced me to grow up fast.

I usually do not mention my age because people judge based on it. Most assume I am older and I prefer to let them think that way.

Here are a few things that helped me:

• Communication is key. You should be able to sell yourself and your ideas. Learn how to speak clearly and confidently. The way you explain things can change how people see your value

• Build connections with the right people and maintain them

• Dress well and invest in how you look. First impressions matter more than you think. How you present yourself often decides whether people take you seriously

• Be friendly with your coworkers but remember they are not your friends

• Understand how workplace politics work. I know it is a controversial topic, but politics happen whether you like it or not. You do not have to play dirty or try to screw someone over, but you should be aware enough that no one screws you

• Keep learning new skills you can find almost everything for free now

• Have fun along the way or you will burn out

• Be smart with your money and think long term

• Read a lot because it sharpens how you think and speak

• Surround yourself with people who make you better. You become like the three people you spend the most time with

I like to think there was luck involved, but most of it came from staying curious, being consistent, and knowing how to handle people.

If anyone has questions, ask me anything. I will try to answer as best as I can.",600,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1o8pqg0/im_25_earning_550k_a_month_without_a_degree_or/,1760668703.0

1ikiz30,Checked into a Hotel in Negombo. Got a Live Adult Show at the Pool 🤮,post,"Checked into a hotel in Negombo today at 1:00 PM. They game me early checkin, Looked decent, took the kids straight to the pool, It was full of tourists, and was ready to relax, until I saw *something*.

A tourist couple was in the pool:

* The woman (*sperm dispenser*) standing in 1.2m deep water.
* The man (*brain-dead sex-starved moron*) floating on an inflatable bed.

She was standing up giving him **oral** right there, under the hot sun, trying to hide it with a hat.

**First thought:** *Is she going to swallow, or are we all about to be swimming in fresh protein shakes?*

**Then realised:** Maybe they booked bed & breakfast, but she got **hungry** and decided to suck him off for **lunch**. 🤮 cheap ass whore.

**Rant**  
Now, listen. If you want to act like animals, do it in your damn room. I wouldn’t have cared if I was alone, but I had my **kids** with me. I don’t want them getting an early OnlyFans subscription at a **family hotel pool**.

And guess what? Other tourists didn’t even seem bothered. Maybe it’s normal for them? Maybe they’re all into pool flavored sperm cocktails? One old dude (*stiffy club president*) with a boner sipping his drink, watching like it was a free premium Pornhub trial.

I reported it to reception. Their brilliant solution *“Sir, just move to the other side of the pool.”*  
Their setups was like multiple pools connected with a bar in the middle.

I paid the same as everyone else, but apparently, I’m the outsider in my Country.

They spoke to the manager, and instead of kicking out **the couple literally getting sucked off in broad daylight**, they offered me a *refund*. No arguments, no shame.

Just: *""We will process your refund, please leave. Maybe come back in the off-season.""*

I even showed them my kids camera footage on my laptop (don’t worry, I’m not posting it). The staff were all sweating like I was about to post it online and ruin their reputation.

So yeah, here I am, typing this while waiting for my refund. Moral of the story?  
**Sri Lankan hotels don’t care about locals.** Tourists can do whatever the hell they want, but if a local complains? *Give them a refund and send them away.*

To all tourists visiting SL: **KEEP YOUR KINKS IN YOUR ROOM.**

Arriving in a tuk-tuk, Senuri Munasinghe was told they couldn’t use the main entrance. Why? Because it was ""reserved for other vehicles"" for ""convenience."" But whose convenience? Since when did the way you get there define your worth as a guest? If this is their policy, where’s the notice? Or is it just another form of selective discrimination?

Sri Lanka already battles enough inequalities. Do we really need luxury hotels like Cinnamon Life to promote double standards? Hospitality should be about welcoming people, no matter how they arrive—not about judging them by the vehicle they choose.

A stark reminder that true luxury is about the respect we give, not the price tag on your ride.

""𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝𝐧'𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞! 🫡 #Discrimination

Luxury is not just about grand buildings and fine dining—it’s about respect, inclusivity, and hospitality. Cinnamon Life, a hotel which is part of my favorite hotel chains, failed miserably at this. Today, I arrived in a Tuk, only to be told I couldn't use the main entrance—reserved for ‘other vehicles’—because of ‘convenience.’ Convenience for whom? Since when did the mode of transport determine a guest’s worth? If this is policy, where’s the notice? Or is it just selective discrimination?

Sri Lanka is battling enough inequalities—do we really need five-star hotels reinforcing double standards? Hospitality should start at the doorstep, not at the price tag of the vehicle you arrive in. Absolutely appalling.

1o9mzto,Saw this post on Facebook. Read the full post in the Description,post,"[Original Post](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17MtHkqLpS/)

Some travel creators come to Sri Lanka and somehow make it look miserable.

They’ll stay in the cheapest guesthouses, eat at the cheapest kadés most locals wouldn’t even go near, and then complain about “how bad the food is.” They’ll sit on the third-class train for the vibe, then act surprised it’s crowded. They’ll order pasta from a roadside kadé and say, “Don’t expect good Italian in Sri Lanka.”
Like… babe, no one asked you to.

And what’s wild is that their currency is so much stronger. Sri Lanka is more than affordable for them. If you can’t afford the bare minimum - a clean stay, a decent meal - maybe don’t travel.

Some even brag about ""surviving on one meal a day"" as if that's cultural immersion. Or they charm their way into the homes of kind locals who share their food out of generosity, then turn it into a pity-filled vlog about ""humble hospitality."" That's not adventure, that's entitlement dressed as authenticity.

Because while they’re out here “roughing it for content,” we’re the ones carrying file loads of proof just to apply for a visa - bank statements, property letters, job confirmations. And even then, we get rejected. When we do travel, we actually spend. Respectfully, responsibly. We don’t turn someone’s daily life into a poverty aesthetic for clicks.

What they never show are the things that make this island magic: The auntie who insists you take another serving. The tuk driver who tells you his life story in ten minutes flat. The chaos that somehow finds its rhythm.
That’s the Sri Lanka we know.

Travel is a privilege.

1l8l4in,"🕯️ In Remembrance – June 11, 1990 🕯️LTTE Genocide of 774 UNARMED Sri Lankan Policemen",post,"**Today, June 11, 2025**, we solemnly mark **35 years since the horrific massacre of 774 Sri Lankan police officers** by the LTTE in the Eastern Province—a dark and painful day in our nation’s history.

On this day in 1990, acting on the instructions of then-President R. Premadasa, **IGP Ernest Perera ordered over 600 police officers to surrender to the LTTE**, falsely believing in a promise of safety. These officers—Sinhalese and Muslims alike—laid down their arms, trusting the leadership of the nation they had sworn to serve. Instead, they were betrayed—**massacred one by one** in cold blood by the very terrorists to whom they had been surrendered.

Let us not forget that this tragedy was not only the result of LTTE’s brutality, but also of **political miscalculations** and **dangerous appeasement policies**. While our servicemen were being executed, LTTE leaders were reportedly given VIP treatment and even housed in luxury, with government-provided security. Meanwhile, **the bodies of our heroes arrived home without ceremony, in ambulances that became all too familiar on our roads**.

📍 **Where was the international outcry?**  
How many UN reports, foreign documentaries, or human rights statements have honored these men?  
**Where are the visits to their families, the memorials, the global condemnations?**

Instead, we often see selective mourning and one-sided narratives—commemorating those who waged war against the state, while **ignoring those who died defending it**.

This massacre **exposed the futility of the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord (1987)** and **foreshadowed the failure of later so-called peace processes**, like the 2002 Norwegian-brokered Ceasefire Agreement. It was not peace that was achieved—but silence in the face of terrorism, and political maneuvering that cost hundreds of lives.

We remember **Assistant Superintendent Ivan Boteju**, who refused to surrender and fought until the end. We remember the fallen from **Batticaloa, Vellaveli, Kalmunai, Valachenai, Kalawanchikudi, Samanthurai, Eravur, Akkaraipattu**—men who stood their ground and paid the ultimate price.

🕯️ **May we never forget. May we never repeat these mistakes. May their sacrifice inspire truth, justice, and true peace.**

1niyqnj,Why should we offer an unncessary privilege to religious pople?,post,"Yesterday I went to a doctor. To avoid the long queues, I went to the place 30 minutes before it opens. When I go here, there were two another families waiting already so I was the third. After us there were 7 more people and then came a buddhist nun (silmaniyo) with another lady. For the contrary I'm also a buddhist. 

As soon as the doctor start to consult the patients, above said nun jumped the queue without questioning and went straight to the doctor. I was angry and then I asked her nicely to not to do that hence we were early birds so she must have wait till his number. But she insisted that doctor asked her to come inside. Then I asked doctor whether he called the nun first and he said no. 

Then the nun and her accomplice started to throw tantrums at me saying ""parents of this guy seems never gave a dhaana to the religious people, these people don't know how to respect the robe etc"" . I got furious and said  ""shut the fuck up without knowing an inch about me. When did the lord buddha said to alawaka to respext the robe when alawaka shouted at lord buddha to come in and go out of his house several times? Respext is not given but somethin to earn so and so""

Then the doctor came and asked me to calm down and said that he will examine the nun first and send her off quickly simply to avoid any confusions. When my turn came, the doctor apologized to me and said, ""these people using the robe to get some privileges and it is good that you raised your voice hence  some locals are offended when I don't give a chance to nun no matter how late she is"" 

Trust me if she had waitied in the queue as others until her number comes up, I would've given her my position and took her number. I've done ot couple of times. But these sort of pathetic disgusting behaviors I hate to see.

Rant over.

Just some onions, meat and a trash ""miris hodi"" doesn't make a good kottu, but that seems to be what almost every restaurant here (including the kottu dedicated almost fancy ones) are doing. It's disgusting, makes you bloated for days and worst of all tastes like shit.

The only decent kottu is at Ricorn, but that's also a hit or miss sometimes, once got served almost spoilt one. 

And many of these lazy fuckers hide behind the fad of ""cheese kottu"" to hide their deplorable kottu making skills. Masking everything with an overpowering flavor of milk and cheese doesn't hide the fact that the food was shit initially. 

If there's any decent places (not just in Colombo, anywhere), would like to compile a list


Edit: After reading the responses (seems like this a passionate topic for many lol), I have to say many ppl have far lower standards of what good kottu is, or are far too young to remember how great even random cheap ass hotel kottu used to taste earlier, or it has always been this way and I'm just having a mixture of false memory and nostalgia...

We’re gonna have a 40 minute panel at Lanka Comic Con on Saturday the 30th of August at 1.30 PM. Would really appreciate as many people joining as possible cus we’re trying to get the word around so that by the time of the demo release it’s easier to get investors onboard to commit to a full game.

It’s in no way a triple-A blockbuster game. It’s a side scroller set in a 3D world and 8-bit characters. We’re building it on Unreal Engine 5 on some pretty dated hardware but managing. It’s a slowburn horror game that’s conversation and mystery heavy.

Please check out our insta for screenshots and gameplay snippets - @bygone.game - 

Once again what we want help with is just for peeps to show up at the panel. We’ll be doing a big breakdown about what we’re doing as well as a casting call for voice actors etc. the panel is free (all the panels are, in the LCC entrance fee). This is a pure lankan effort so we would really really appreciate any of you’ll who are interested turning up and giving us a listen and a look. Out eventual goal is to release a full game but also try and raise more indie devs who have a flair for doing cool weird projects like this. WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR MONEY OR FUNDING - let me make that clear. Even our eventual demo launch will be FREE. What we want right now is all the PR we can get.

Hope to see some of you guys there! Once again our insta handle is @bygone.game

Lol I hope this post doesn’t count as product advertising cus once again - not doing this for any commercial monetary gain (at least right now).

1ent2ff, Australian Education is a Scam,post,"You people have no fucking clue how hard it is to move to Australia and settle down there. All these folks dreaming about Australian education are falling for a huge scam. Unless you have a full scholarship or come from a super-rich family, going to Australia for higher education is the dumbest fucking decision you can make. I'm so sick of all those who scam people into thinking they'll have a better life in Australia. It's simply not true at all. It's a fucking disaster A BIG ONE IF your parents aren't rich. It's a carefully designed scam that the ausi govt runs since one of their largest exports is education.

Getting PR is like chasing a mirage. They change the policy every damn year so you have to take more courses to get PR, which means you pay them more. If you want to experience hell, just come to Australia. I feel sorry for middle-class people without a rich family background who want to study abroad. You have no one to talk to when you feel like shit, and you'll feel lonely as hell. I know Sri Lanka is a third-world, shitty country with shitty politics, but we have free university education and free healthcare. If you don’t get selected to a government university as an internal student, there are super budget-friendly courses available in government universities that you can still follow. We have our parents to talk to when we feel sad, we’re free on weekends to go on super low-budget trips, we have beaches all around the island, we have friends we love, and we have food that's cheap as fuck (think about pol roti and lunu miris). You never know how hard it is to live abroad until you try it. We have everything in Sri Lanka to live a normal fucking life even though we’re not super rich.

I don't really want a big house, a supercar, or fancy clothes. I just want to live a normal, happy life with my loved ones.

So I started building docreview.lk - a platform to search, review and find great doctors in SL. 

And I’m thinking of building it in public and taking you on a journey with myself as well.

For now - reviews are the most important thing. If you wanna support someone find a good doctor please head over to docreview.lk and drop a review on whoever doctor you have been to.

- I found people in Sri Lanka to be really friendly and helpful and many locals would strike up a conversation with me or help me out.
- No one in Colombo seems to wear shorts.
- The level of English was really good, almost everyone I spoke to had a decent level of English.
- School trips seem to be popular here: I saw huge groups of school children wearing white in Anuradhapura, Sigiriya, and Colombo.
- I only went to one major supermarket, but it was really impressive. I went to a Keells in Colombo, and it had a café, kitchen, meat and fish counter, donuts, and pastries.
- The money has quite a strong odour, perhaps because it's not plastic?
- Lavish is not a commonly used word in English, but I saw it often in Sri Lanka, especially in advertising.
- Murals outside schools: I saw many of these, and I thought they had a lot of striking and meaningful images.
- The longer I stayed, the more I started to understand the headshake and its many meanings.

Best part: Sri Lanka's wildlife. Across the country I saw magnificent trees, varied wildlife, and lots of birds.  

Most challenging part: Navigating Colombo bus station and taking a 6-hour bus ride to Anuradhapura.

I have never personally heard of any Sinhala family or individual I know supporting the massacre.

For instance, my parents sheltered their neighboring Tamil family in their home, saving them from harm. Similarly, my wife’s parents, who were living in Soysa Flats, along with other Sinhalese residents, protected all their Tamil neighbors in the building. They prevented the goons from reaching the stairway by throwing homemade kerosene bombs from the upper floors.

1o9ac7o,Response to Watawala tea advert - I am Transgender Female and I am Sinhala Buddhist,post,"I am transgender. Transitioning from male to female and I am in my 40s.  

I am Buddhist who went to Sunday school, studied Pali/Abhidharma and I went to an all boy's Catholic school. Now I reside abroad but visit Sri Lanka every year.  

(Down votes incoming...)
  
Coming out to my parents was the hardest thing I had to do. But I couldn't live a lie. I came out they didn't take it so well. They swore at me with all the kunu Sinhala words imaginable. I laughed (my coping mechanism) at the time because I did expect it. But that didnt mean it didnt hurt. I didn't speak to them for few months. But now, I think they realised and ignoring its happening. It seems they are coming around.   
  
My Aunts and uncles know. Some are supportive. Some sucking it up. All my cousins are ecstatic. My closest male friends whom I grew up is genuinely happy for me and supportive. 
  
Put my transition into perspective
  
My aunts and uncles (well most of them) were loving.  
My family is a Buddhist conservative and what you would call ""typical"" respectful Buddhist middle class family. If there were any family problems they shielded me from it. There was a time when my dad went bankrupt and had to sell everything and struggled to put me through uni. But still, they shielded me and I am loved. My parents did their best. I am/was blessed.  
  
I am the eldest golden child of extended family. I am the friend your parents would point to and say ""why can't you be like him.. Why can't you behave like him? Why cant you get grades like him""   
  
I didn't even know what the word ""fuck"" means until I was may be 15-16. You know sex education wasn't a thing. I remember sitting in Maths class and kids laughing out ""pi"" . I.e. I didn't realise they were making fun about innuendo ""paiyya"".  

That's the kind of environment I grew up in.
  
I was a happy kid, least I thought..  
  
Underneath it all... I did feel different. I often thought about being a girl. What it would be like to be a girl. Thinking about girl clothes.  I didn't know where it comes from. At times it scared the hell out of me.  
  
I didn't know better... I had ""nightmares"" of being born a girl in my next life. Sometimes, secretly I played dress up, put on on make up. These feelings and acts did not come from internet/TV. There was nothing. It LGBTQ+ wasn't part of my upbringing.
  
I felt like a ""pervert"" I felt disgusted with myself. I didn't know how to process it. I didnt even know LGBTQ is a thing. I never knew anyone. Sometimes for days, months, or even years I'd be able to ""suppress"" it. I didn't realise what was ""wrong"" with me and kept coming at me and following me like a shadow.  
  
---  

It's only in my late 20s early 30s I realised what's happening. Later in my life I knew Transgender exists, gay, bi, lesbian exists. It took time but then one day it just clicked to me. There is nothing wrong with me. I am just in wrong body. It didn't click I am one of them.   
  
I knew coming out would cost me everything. I knew what everyone would say. I knew I will be abandoned. I knew I won't be invited to family events. I knew I'll go from golden child to ""pariah"". I was fully prepared to blow it all up. 

I'm so glad it didn't get that bad. I feel I am one of the lucky ones.
  
--- 

Point is... there is no advert, no propaganda, association, group, person that can make you LGBTQ+. Existence of people like us predates history of Sri Lanka. You either are or you're not. You're not going to get infected, forced into being LGBTQ+.

Watawla tea not going to change you into something you're not. If you think it does well I have news for you... ;-)
  
LGBTQ+ is not the reason why Sri Lanka as a nation... or Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim etc as an Ethnicity would become extinct or become degenerate.  
  
It is the greed, hate, selfishness, bigotry, misogyny, colonial slave mindset, exists within our communities and even families that will cause down fall.
  
We as LGBTQ+ just want to exists and have our rights respected just like anybody else and have kindness and compassion Lord Buddha taught us to show.   
  
Before you start looking at LGBTQ representation as a problem you should look at your own problems in your family and country.  Can't look after parents, gossiping /cheating aunties and uncles, child labour, human trafficking to Arabaic countries, rape, sexual harassment, destruction of nature, wildlife, corruption, nepotism list goes on...

So, if your biggest problem is minority wanting to just exist go fuck yourself.  You're worse than a bowel cancer...

The owner of the guest house was such a horrible, horrible man and if somehow this stops someone else coming into contact with him then I'll chalk it up to a win. I am a solo female traveler. From the get go, he was constantly making comment about my breasts and tried to grab them more than once. He claimed to not have a confirmation of my booking, even after showing him my confirmation, he just kept saying he didn't have a booking (didn't even check anything). He then overcharged me for my booking by nearly double. He kept hassling me to go to the fish market and that if I got some fish, he would cook for free. I had noticed prices were quite high in the area, so I agreed. He then spends the drive to the market asking if I 'enjoy fucking"" and saying how beautiful I was etc. Then he demands 1500 lkr for driving me and disappears and never even cooks my food. I later find the fish hidden in the back of his personal freezer. I told him I was unhappy with him and all he did was laugh in my face. He is an awful little creep and I hope that karma kicks his ass. He has made it so I cannot review on booking.com. Upon looking on Trip Advisor, there are multiple people who say that he has robbed them. He brings shame and a bad name to an otherwise beautiful country.",410,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1hhreyv/unfortunate_experience_in_unawatuna_masith/,1734609792.0

Like…..Why do people just not like other people being happy when it does absolutely no harm to anyone? Why? Or are they trying to act “matured” and be the “main character” by “being different”? 

I’m not saying everyone should love what I love. Of course if you hate it, you can hate it. I respect that. But this feels kinda off isn’t it? It gives me “Oh everyone like this so I must not like it because I’m different” vibes.

1ldh5v7,Final letter from a soldier to his mother. He laid down his life during the op. His mental resilience was astonishing.,post,"Date: 04 (Today)
War

Dear Amma (Mother) and Thaththa (Father),

Amma, I’m still safe. A week ago, we arrived in the jungle. Yesterday, we attacked a major camp. We fought from 9 in the morning until night and captured it. Tomorrow, we’re attacking another camp. Amma, please don’t be sad. Soldiers must fight. I came on this journey after thinking a lot.

So, with God’s blessing, I’m still on the front line, unshaken. You should be proud of that, Amma. I’m writing this letter with great difficulty from deep inside the jungle. They’ll send it by helicopter tomorrow.

Amma, even if I die, please don’t grieve. I won’t die running away in fear or hiding. Even if I die, I’ll die fighting forward like a true commando soldier. So Amma, don’t be afraid or sad. Be happy.

It’s dark now. I’ll stop here.

May the blessings of the Buddha be with you, Amma, Thaththa, Nangi (younger sister), and everyone.

Your son,

1iqv0nh,How keells treat their employees ( Part 02 ),post,"Two or three days ago I made a post about how keells treat their cashiers , Employees and this is the part two. 

There’s ever a cash shortage at the till no matter the reason the amount is deducted from the cashier’s salary. No excuses.  We’re given targets to sell green bags and Nexus mobile tokens. If we dont sell promotion items  ( there is also a target ) they dont even let us go home if we have 7 - 4 pm shift we must go  6 , 7 pm if we dont sell promoton items. .If we don’t meet these targets, they cut our salaries. Last month they cut  7000 rupees from our CRO. 
 
 Once a fruit  tagged wrong (wood apple tagged as pomegranate), and because we didn’t notice they deducted money from our salaries.  
 
 A trainee lost a pack of Dunhill cigars,and every cashier had to pay 3000+ rupees to cover the loss.  
  and one time A foreigner gave a fake 5000 rupeebill and the cashier who accepted it had the full amount deducted from her salary  

 Our POS machines have a feedback system where customers can rate things like whether the vegetables, bread, or fish are fresh. If a customer selects “No,” we get scolded or punished. How is this our fault?  

Once they found a few short expired items in the store and an employee had 7000 rupees deducted from their salary.
   If a customer complains, even about a small mistake, they don’t hesitate to fire or punish us. For example they’ll force us to “punch” green bags from our POS as a punishment.  

If we’re even a few minutes late to work, they mark it as “no pay,” meaning we have to work the entire day without salary. It’s so demoralizing.  

Some outlet managers cut employees’ overtime pay just because of minor mistakes. It feels like they’re always looking for ways to take money from us.  

We’re forced to work insanely long hours – sometimes 16, 17 hours, or even overnight shift  And for all this, our basic salary is just 21,000 rupees It’s impossible to maintain a work-life balance.  

Employees especially cashiers look like raccoons because we don’t have enough time to sleep eat, or even drink water. The workload is relentless, and it’s taking a toll on our physical and mental health.  

There is communist chinse gov.  sh!t going on our outlets. They monitor  us through CCTVs they randomly take photos automatically every few hours. It called ""captures ""  "" Queue captures"" 

This is just a summery

But despite that, my family constantly insults me even my younger brother and sister. I’m the oldest, yet they still call me things like “wdakata nathi eka” and “pawlata bara eka.”
Both of my parents are professors at a government university, and they often mock me because of my salary. I currently earn around 80k, but they keep comparing me to my friends who make 150k or more. They also compare me to their colleagues’ children who got into medicine or engineering.

I actually got selected for architecture at Moratuwa University, but I didn’t like that field, so I decided to switch paths and study software engineering at a private university instead. Even though I’m working hard and doing my best, the constant criticism and comparisons never stop.

Whenever I try to speak up, my parents defend my siblings instead. I know I’m grown ass man, but it really hurts to be mocked every day especially by my own family.

1o21unn,"Sri Lanka, a major disappointment",post,"I had commented on how I felt about Sri Lanka on another post, only to be just downvoted and asked to leave the country, but I feel that this could serve as a warning for for coming travelers and maybe as a board of discussion for the locals. 

I just want to start by saying that I have been travelling Asia for 10 years now, and have been living in Asia continously for the last 5 years, i am not new to this and in no way an amateur traveller. I want to point out some of the things that made me positive that I will never come back to this island. 

But first, let me list the good:

The nature: Sri Lanka is very very green! Most of Asia is, but here, the nature feels, for a lack of a better word, compressed, in one tiny area you could have a very large number of trees and plants, it beautiful, and it just feels so jungly without the rough bits but only the pretty ones,there is also plenty of open nature which is also just gorgeous. 

The weather: been here from July till October, and honestly The weather is just lovely, it gets hot sometimes sure, but never the sort of heat like u would face in Vietnam or south India, it's very bareble and almost everywhere I have been ( central and south) the nights are cool and pleasant, except one or two places known for their heat. 


The bad:

Constant harassment: I have travelled Asia, Europe, Africa and the middle east, Sri Lanka is the first country where I actually had to yell at someone. The harassment is relentless, it's nonstop, the tuktuk drivers, the men in the street, the shop owners, it is nonstop that at some point I just wore my headphones to block out the noise and completely stopped responding. 

Unsafe for women: most travelling women I have met had said that they felt very unsafe here if alone, which made sense because I noticed that most travellers here come in two, in my three months here, I think I met a single woman travelling solo from spain, and she herself said that she always went to very secluded beaches so no one would harras her, and even then never felt comfortable wearing her swimsuit. Sri Lankan men are creepy, with an air of very misplaced of confidence which honestly is just gross, never have I felt safe around them. The ""hello! Hello!"" ""Where are you going?"" Is literally nonstop, just constant background noise. 

The dishonesty: everybody smiles, but it is almost immediately followed by asking for money in one form or another, behind the smiles is nothing but grifting. Multiple times I had the booking.com hosts charge me the commission that booking.com charges them, and get very upset when I tell them no. There is this air of ""hustling"" that everyone has that honestly anywhere else would just be seen as straight up scamming. I have ALWAYS been short changed, they somehow never have the right change, until u refuse to pay, and then suddenly they remember the other pocket. Many restaurants I have been to had hidden local menus and then the tourist menu that is about 4 times more expensive than the average price 

Rude and proud: I came to Sri Lanka, because as someone who has studied and practices Buddhism I was hoping Buddhist qualities to be around, all I found was this extreme pride in being ""pure budhists"" while exhibiting not a single trait of it, people are rude, they ignore you midsentence and get offended at anything, and again the constant harrasment and grifting. Even the monks were rude, not all, but most had their air of superiority around them, whole they are supposed to be kind, humble and compassionate. 


All in all this was an experience, I stayed longer because I didn't want to judge from one or two experiences, and I wanted to see for myself if it's different in other places of the country. Sri Lanka has been a major disappointment and I will never be coming back here again, now will I ever advice anyone to come. 

End rant 

Edit: been getting the kind of responses you would expect from such a post, and that's cool, wanted to share my experience, and everyone is allowed to react as they feel is accurate . 

Edit 2: some people have pointed out that the smiling for the sake of grifting bit is not true or exaggerated, if you go to r/digitalnomad u will see a few people complaining about the same thing. Scamming is common anywhere that much is true, but the whole pretending to be your friend or wanting to chat only to try to hook u in is just cheap, I even had one guy convince me that my bus is not coming, and that I should go with him to some other town where I can get another bus ;/ , like really, wtf is that. 

Edit 3: the comments I guess serve my point, you have honest Sri lankans agreeing or half agreeing with me (many made great pro and cons points, which I really appreciate), and then those that talk like I am talking gibberish and must have been in another dimension, and also downvoting the other srilankans because they won't just deny anything bad said about the county, this the pride and easily offended bit that I was talking about. No growth will ever come from this

1ikjblh,AKD and govt are just as corrupted as previous governments,post,"Before AKD’s win, I posted here about his plans on political corruption within the Sri Lankan Foreign Service. 

So many comments did the classic of “Shut up, AKD is going to push the country in the right path” bs. I ended up deleting the post because it was so evident the political bs that some of you had consumed. 

Fast forward a few months, they’ve proven they’re nothing better than the previous governments. The only difference now is, finally people are now calling them out. 

Moral of story is - every politician is capable of flagging and bashing the previous government’s corruptive behaviour but their true colours come out once the power lands on them. 

Just so you support a particular political candidate, it doesn’t mean you should support them blindly. 

If it’s truly the country’s best interests that lie within your heart, support the person you best think is suited but it’s also your responsibility to hold them ACCOUNTABLE when they unapologetically commit the same corruptive tactics that previous governments employed to destroy this country.

1enziq5,This is what Ranil Did for Sri Lankan Economy for Real,post,"1. In 2014 Sri Lanka's economy was in good condition. When Ranil and his set of goons came to power in 2015, they went to IMF seeking a bailout. IMF response was that SL does not need a bail out and SL was doing well financially. 

2. Just after an year, Ranil made a mess of our finances to such an extent, IMF stated that SL was in need of urgent attention and a bailout. That is Ranil's achievement in a single year.

3. The reason for SL's economic crisis is debt crisis. The debt crisis was a result of Ranil's bad debt management during the period of Yahapalna, 2015-2019. During that period, our debt to GDP ratio went so high, our GDP growth rates plummeted.

4. But what was most concerning is the excessive level of ISB loans taken by Ranil Wick' government during 2015-19. Yahapalana gov had taken 12.5 Billion ISB loans, that means international sovereign bond loans from commercial capital markets. 

5. Ranil took ISB loans excessively in such a scale that ISB component in total debt was increased from 12% to 50%. That is a HUGE increase. That is the single biggest reason for SL bankruptcy. From 2020 we had to pay huge loan installments. In 2022 itself, our loan installment was 7 billion.

6. These bond loans are with no strings attached unlike project loans and government can spend money as they wish. And that is what Ranil did. During the 2015-19 period, SL's import bill had skyrocketed. Ranil himself accepted in 2016-17 that their policies led to the increase in Aggregate demand and hence a higher import bill. How did we finance them? Of course, by loaning excessive amount of ISB loans. 

7. No matter how much of an idiot Gotabaya was with his fertiliser ban and ban on burial of Muslim Covid dead, Gota is not single handedly responsible for the mess. A big part of the blame should go to Ranil Wick who was responsible for irresponsible financial management. 

8. After the Aragalaya, he luckily got the presidency post. One of the first things, he tried to do was changing the governor of the Central Bank, Nandalal. He wanted his man, Dinesh Weerakkody in the post. But that was averted because Sajith questioned it and opposed it in the parliament. 

9. After declaring bankruptcy, SL has simply suspended loan payments. Therefore we have the chance to build our reserves. So we have 5 billion reserves. But out of the 5 billion, more than 3 billion are from currency swaps. So they are again loans. 

10. Our factories are closed, many companies taking their operations overseas, no FDI into the country, more than half million has disconnected electricity, the fuel usage of the country has dropped by 50%. That means we are seeing the gradual downfall of our economy. The only thread by which our economy hangs on is tourism. If another pandemic like Covid hits us, we will be facing difficulties. 

11. Even if we dont have a pandemic, Ranil and his corrupt goons have let some Indian petti kade to carry on our visa process at a hefty sum. Our tourism sector is taking a hit because we need to make sure this Indian petti kade is making profits. Just look at the findings of the investigations. 

12. About debt restructure, he has simply agreed to unfavorable debt restructure deal. We have only 3 years to set our economy right and start paying loans. 

13. This man has no vision. Just look at how he manages the egg shortage in the country, just import from India. Is poultry business such a high tech industry, that we cannot make enough eggs for our own usage? 

14. And guess what, our debt issue has only worsened. Within 2023 itself, SL's debt increased by 16 Billion dollars. That is not solving a debt crisis. If anyone thinks Ranil who created the conditions for bankruptcy is solving the issue and will solve the issue, needs to get their head checked.

1jb0s6d,Hate on doctors and the overall medical profession,post,"Recently all over reddit/social media ive come across several posts against doctors striking for their rights in the workplace. Why is that exactly?
Primarily id like to state that the salary the government pays to a basic doctor is Rs 250,000 a month! $800 a month for saving lives and treating the ill lmao.This is before taxes. Before most of the brainwashed talk about private practice basic doctors mostly dont practice privately this is done by those who complete specialties after theyre fucking 35-40.

Ive seen comments on people stating “doctors think of themselves as demigods” and so on but are the same fools who argue that if doctors strike that the people fall into great hardship! As a practicing doctor honestly this post is a fuck you to all the idiots who claim this shit and dont respect us for the work we do! Working bloody full day shifts for 10 months in our internship to being oncall in places with no bloody security! All while having to listen to complaints from ungrateful patients who yap their way all while not paying a cent for the treatment they receive 
More importantly the nurses and attendants toil day in and day out while receiving constant harassment and catcalling from these ungrateful buggers in wards while being paid pennies

Doctors working in srilanka arent idiots either we topped our exams and entered in merit to these universities only to earn less than an uber driver
“ you learnt from the tax the people pay be grateful” grateful we are but being raped harassed groped in hospitals isnt something we ll tolerate for tht

In conclusion unless doctors strike you ll will never realize how valuable and important we “demigods” are to society so strike we will! This will be ten fold in the newer generations to come!

1gwfspi,Transphobia in the sub and a message to trans and queer Sri Lankans,post,"With TDOR around the corner and the recent transphobia I received from comments here, I thought I'd make a post to you my fam.

A little background first. With the economic crisis and the mass exodus, I too left to Australia for studies like many others who had the means and the capacity to move out. Apart from a few things happening in my personal life, I was feeling excited about truly finding myself. Finding my identity as a woman also meant thinking about the implications about how gender intersects with other aspects like ethnicity and culture. I have had the privilege of seeing others going through journeys like me: their struggles as well as their joys. When I came to Australia, I realised how I am seen by White society for my skin colour and accent. It's as if the outside perception of myself as trans was eclipsed by perception of me being someone unwelcome from ""the subcontinent"". My ethnic and national identity (the little I held on to) made it easier to deflect the shame that white / Western people hurled at me. For all my Sri Lankan trans and queer siblings who are out there, from all religions and creeds, know that you aren't alone. I am proud of you. Cis / straight people don't have a monopoly over our culture even if they pretend. We've always been around and we will always be.

1es8mi4,NPP exposed- vote wisely. ,post,"https://x.com/arsh_group/status/1823715823552454906?s=46



Props to him for speaking up. 
NPP on countless occasions have proven that they have no clue what they say. 

AKD plans on releasing their economic manifesto on the 10th of September. 11 days before the elections to obviously try and cover up the criticism they’ll get. 

SJB, the other main contender will be releasing the updated(from the 2019 version) blue print before the end of the month. 

We already know RW plan, it’s been bearing fruit. 

This might come off as pro SJB but this is the 21 amendment they proposed back in 2022:

The Samagi Jana Balawegaya has presented the proposed 21th Amendment bill to the Secretary General of Parliament.
Its proposals include: 1) Abolition of the current Executive Presidency: Parliament to elect President
2) Cabinet will be continuously accountable and responsible to Parliament, can be removed by no confidence motion Establish Constitutional Council & independent commissions including Audit & Procurement Commissions
3) Reduction of Maximum Cabinet Ministers to 25, maximum of non-cabinet and deputy Ministers to 25. No increase of Ministers in event of coalition government
4) Stringent provisions to prevent corrupt crossovers
5) Constitutional recognition of National Security Council
6) Establish a State Council to obtain advice of experts / public representations on matters of public importance
7) Re-establishing Constitutional democracy and protecting sovereignty of people through the above”

This is why Dulas was nominated to run for president when SLPP decided to vote RW into presidency. SP was planning on abolishing Ex-presidency. 

Not to mention almost all the anti corruption probs were launched by SJb. Not NPP. In fact, as per Harsh, NPP did not attend a single meeting regarding the VFS scam. 

Make of this what you wish. Some people act e.i. RW/SP and others talk. 

Note: we wouldn’t have had an economic crisis if SJb had won back in 2019. They were always against the tax cuts that triggered the crisis as well as called for IMF back in 2020.

Vote wisely guys. ☮️

We need to be conscious of this as the majority in a country with such a violent past.

I am not Tamil and I don’t support LTTE/Tamil Eelam at all but it worries me that this is all it takes for us to turn on each other. We have to be united and learn to coexist because there are people in power who will profit from conflict, and I don’t just mean politicians in our country. Just like it happened in the past, there will be attempts to create conflict between us. We need to be smart and we need more media literacy.

Many people became very uncomfortable after seeing the recent advertisement. Most were deeply upset about child protection, saying things like, “Don’t show that kind of thing to our kids!” Even the boy in the ad was mocked and turned into memes in a very disrespectful way. I have to share my two cents about it! (I’ve used some Pali words written in English here.)



# Are LGBTQ+, homosexuality, and transgender people new Western concepts that destroy Buddhist culture?

No. Homosexuality has existed throughout human history for thousands of years — and it’s been observed in thousands of other animal species too. It’s a very natural, evolutionarily significant, and common occurrence. Many modern studies have found that it’s not only due to social or environmental factors — genetic and hormonal influences also play an undeniable role.  
Studies with identical and fraternal twins have proven that genetics has a clear influence, and that hormonal exposure from the mother during fetal development also contributes. It’s not caused by one single gene, but a combination of several genes. So, is it unnatural? No — it’s a perfectly natural biological process.



# The same goes for transgender identity.

We know that human sex is determined by the 23rd pair of chromosomes — XX for females, XY for males.  
But sometimes, children are born with variations such as:

* **XO – Turner Syndrome**
* **XXY – Klinefelter Syndrome**
* **XYY – Jacobs Syndrome**

This means children can be born with male organs but female traits and hormones, or vice versa. These are naturally occurring conditions that happen once in every 1,000–2,000 births.  
Also, due to hormonal influences during fetal development, a child can be born with female anatomy even with male chromosomes.

No one deserves discrimination or hate for being born the way they are. As a Buddhist country, our values should not be to hate or persecute others for natural variations, right?



When I looked into Buddhist teachings, I came across a very insightful conference lecture by **Ven. Gonalagoda Nanda Thero** (Bhiksu University of Sri Lanka, MPhil in Philosophy), titled *“Buddhist Attitude towards Sexual Transformation / Buddhism and Sexual Transformation.”*  
It discusses various references in the **Vinaya Pitaka**, such as the *Atthasālinī, Samantapāsādikā, Sāratthadīpanī, Abhidhammāvatāra,* and *Abhidhammatthavikāsinī.*

Some key points:

* From ancient times, Buddhism has taught that transgender or sexually variant individuals should **not** be discriminated against or persecuted.
* Such conditions are **not caused by actions in this life**, but are **natural consequences of past karma.**
* If a monk transitions, they should move to the appropriate monastery (for example, someone transitioning from male to female should reside in a nunnery).
* The Sangha rules allow them to **keep their ordination and vows** according to their new identity; others are instructed **not to treat them differently.**
* Buddhism recognizes **four gender categories**, not just male and female:
   * **Pandaka** – born male but lacking male characteristics or reproductive ability (including those with genital injuries)
   * **Ubhatobyañjanaka** – having both male and female characteristics (non-binary)

So, if someone thinks LGBTQ+ ideas are “Western woke concepts,” then guess what — the Buddha himself supported LGBTQ+ individuals. That means Buddhism is *the original “woke” religion*. If you have a problem with that, maybe you’re following the wrong faith!



# Where did this strong homophobia come from then?

You might have heard of **Victorian morality.**  
That refers to the social code of Queen Victoria’s era (1837–1900) in the West.  
Concepts like covering every inch of your body, never talking about sexuality in front of children, avoiding premarital sex, and valuing virginity before marriage — all of that was imported by colonizers from 1815 onward. It’s Western puritan culture.  
We shouldn’t cling to it — even they’ve abandoned those views now.

The idea that there are *only two genders* and that homosexuality is a *sin* comes from **Christianity and Abrahamic religions,** not from Buddhism.



So, when you see a boy wearing a sari, does that “make” children turn gay or trans?  
No. These things arise naturally, due to genetics.  
Even if they never see anyone wearing a sari, someone predisposed to that will still do it.  
Someone attracted to men will be attracted to men regardless.  
You can shout, insult, and mock them all you want — but that won’t change their biology.

The *whole purpose of that advertisement* was simply to say:  
**Don’t bully, shame, or try to change children who are different.**  
It’s not about “making your child gay.”



Instead of raging about that ad, maybe the adults shouting online should start talking about the thousands of cases of sexual abuse happening every year in temples and churches — little novice monks and young boys being exploited.  
If action had been taken about that, we’d actually be solving *real* problems children face.  
Ask a forensic doctor or someone working in child protection how many children each year are physically harmed and bleeding from abuse.



And if you look at the loudest people screaming “protect the children” on social media — most of them are:

* Guys with patchy beards or no beards trying to act macho,
* People who’ve never had a girlfriend,
* Absolute virgins bragging about being “alpha males.”

Some are even using this issue for **political gain** — trying to manipulate emotions to bring back the same corrupt families who bankrupted the country.  
They failed to stir nationalism, so now they’re exploiting this issue instead.  
Let’s not forget the people who died when there was no fuel, no medicine, and no food. Don’t let them fool you again.



# In short:

That so-called “sigma male mindset” isn’t strength — it’s just toxic immaturity.  
Don’t become the kind of person who attacks others for being born differently.  
If you really want to be a *“real chad,”* don’t mock people’s gender or sexuality — take a stand against pedophiles who exploit children, even if they wear robes or hold religious titles.

18rza4k,LGBTQ+ friendly reddit chat for Sri Lankan Queers and allies 🏳️‍🌈🇱🇰,post,"Given the recent surge in homophobia in this sub it has become quite clear that this is no longer a safe space for queer folk. I'm not placing any blame on anyone, especially not the moderators who are doing a phenomenal job keeping this sub clear of hate and bullying, but things like the disgusting homophobic comments on that one kids post about trying to spread LGBT awareness and the general change in the atmosphere of this sub that followed are enough red flags.

Given this situation I talked with the kid and he too agreed that the homophobia was terrible and decided that we'd feel better off in a reddit group chat where queer folks and allies can interact freely without any judement or hatred. So, if you're queer yourself or you're an ally please drop comment or a dm and we'd be happy to add you.

1cpbuli,Why do Sinhalese people hate Tamils? ,post,"I was born Sinhalese, and from what I've seen from my home environment and from what has happened some forty years ago and more in this country, I have noticed a racist hatred from the Sinhalese to the Tamil people in this country. Ever since I was little, I have always had young Tamil maids who've worked at my house. While I literally had no feelings of aversion towards them, my mother and other people who used to come to my house always used to stay stuff about them behind their backs (like if they did something wrong, they would be like ""it's how these Tamils are"", ""These Tamils can't do anything right"", or ""oya meh demalunge hati thamai"". Their tone always implied that Tamils are an inferior group of people to the Sinhalese and like they are a people who are neither intelligent nor cannot be trusted. 

I have always loved every singe Tamil maid I've had as I saw most of them as my own sisters. If a Tamil person comes and talks to me, I hardly ever see them for their religion or ethnicity. But my parents aren't the same towards them.

Why is this? Why does this hatred towards Tamils from the Sinhalese people exist? 

PS: A lot of people are offended in the comments. Please note that I obviously do not think that every single Sinhalese person hates Tamils. I just want to know from the Sinhalese people who hate Tamils about why they hate them. My personal life experience is also not a personal attack against you. We've all obviously had different life experiences. Have a great day. ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1cpbuli/why_do_sinhalese_people_hate_tamils/,1715412308.0
1f65s25,Are we heading towards Greece (in 2015) in case if JVP comes into power?,post,"When their left-wing Syriza party came into power, they tried to re-negotiate with IMF and the other creditors, for that they held a referendum to back their populist agenda which they won easily as to gain some leverage over the talks with creditors, which clearly didn’t workout and got them nowhere, all that waste of effort,energy and time worsened the crisis and they were once again pushed back into a brink of another economic collapse, if not for another bailout program by IMF, which led the government to implement even more stricter austerity measures than before, Greece would have fallen to the depths of an unrecoverable economic crisis.

SL people in social media seem to endorse this genius approach, having no clue whatsoever about the history of our world (in this case it’s just few years back), having no understanding about the significance of a given situation, all they know is to get aboard on some stupid trend.

1gdvro3,Where do Sri Lankans stand on gender?,post,"I have a friend who says ‘they’ are non binary and I told this to my boyfriend whose reply was to laugh in my face and go on this whole Andrew Tate tangent that sex is sex and no one is a ‘mouse’ or a ‘toaster’ and that he cant be a ‘white woman’ if he wanted to.

While I do agree that there are two sexes/genitalia or whatever capacities we are born with are either biologically male or female capacities/features. 

But gender is a social construct, so if someone doesn’t want to fit in to the hegemonic narrative or dominant ideology of what a ‘man’ or a ‘woman’ is, that should be okay. In the case of my friend, they were born a woman but aren’t sure of which ideology they fit into. And also they feel closer to the male narrative and isn’t going to commit to surgery because if the unsureness. 

When it comes to my boyfriend said. There are things called ‘discourses’ as proposed by Foucault. Gender is a discourse, like race is, so to mix it is stupid and very Andrew Tate-like, its just to drive a foul point. I don’t even need to address the ‘mouse’ or the ‘toaster’, thats absurd, every discourse has a construct of boundaries. 

I guess he disagrees with the fact that social constructs can actually be constructed by society.

1fbxsyc,"I Think, Therefore I Vote!",post,"With just 13 days left before the Presidential Election in Sri Lanka, I write to explain why I am voting the way I am. This election feels different for me. Unlike in previous years, I've decided to openly share my decision, even though it’s often seen as a personal matter. Living in a developing country for many years—and likely for many more—means we must engage with politics when the time demands it. I believe this is one of those times.

As most of us know, we live in uncertain times, both domestically and internationally. There’s no doubt we live in a globalized world where external forces deeply affect our daily lives. We cannot ignore this reality when making our choice. Sri Lanka is burdened with overwhelming foreign debt, so our primary concern must be to continue the debt restructuring program and ensure it stays sustainable while the economy hopefully grows. For this reason, I think Ranil is the suitable candidate for at least the next three to four years, therefore, I vote for Ranil.

Democracy is vital for Sri Lanka, though perhaps not in the same way as it is for developed countries like Norway or Switzerland. We need a leader with some level of authority, yet with a vision acceptable to all, to steer the country forward—not backward. In this regard, I believe Ranil offers the most suitable vision for progress. Of course, to implement this vision, we need the people—parliamentarians, government officials, entrepreneurs, and private-sector leaders—all working towards that vision willingly or unwillingly. Whether we like it or not, the system will function, and the president’s vision will steer the direction. If we try to take in everyone’s ideas and opinions, we’ll never form a clear vision. Instead, we’ll remain stagnant, which isn’t ideal given our current circumstances. We need momentum, and once we start moving—whether the direction is perfect or not—we can fix issues along the way. That's how progress works. I believe that moving forward, and doing it quickly, is essential to overcoming the major challenges we face.

Now, about the elephant in the room: corruption. People around these candidates, and the candidates themselves, will likely be corrupt and we know it. That’s messy and unavoidable—it’s human nature. So, don't expect everything to be clean and pure. It's better to work with what we have and find solutions rather than dream of an impossible utopia. As the saying goes, ""It’s better to dance with the devil we know than the devil we don’t."" This quote is especially relevant in our current situation. It may feel like ""hell"" here, but the devil we know—Ranil—is a more suitable dance partner than the unknown alternatives. 

We need stability, not revolution, at this moment.
I also believe the upcoming general election will leave no party with a clear majority. We need someone who is willing to work with whoever ends up in parliament, and that requires a leader who can put aside personal principles and ego to make things work with the circumstances they’re given. I repeat: we need to move forward, or we’ll remain stuck, and that will only lead to negative consequences.

If anyone is thinking about revolution, I’d say this is not the time. We’ve seen revolutions throughout history and even in recent decades. What I’ve learned is that after a revolution, we often end up with the same thing, just in a different form. Nothing truly dies; it only changes form. During revolutions, it’s the people who suffer the most, and the result is often more of the same, just repackaged. What we need is not a revolution, but an evolution—a slow, deliberate change. This takes time, and we shouldn’t expect things to improve overnight.

In this economic war, we must focus on where we need to go, rather than what we hope to avoid. Ranil is the most suitable wartime economic leader among the candidates we have. Our country’s survival depends on following a clear mission, and a wartime leader must understand governance, international relations, and when to violate them. I think Ranil is closest to embodying that role, and therefore, I vote for Ranil.

I may not be entirely right, but I believe we already had our “revolution” in 2022, when the people stood up and showed their power. It was quick, but it was exactly what we needed at the time. Now, we must act with intellect, not emotion. It’s time to stabilize, move forward, and live a little. To be honest, I’m tired of the idea of another revolution anytime soon. Aren’t we all?

1ksgpnc,What is Going ON in Sri Lanka guys - from a very confused Aussie,post,"Hey so this is my first ever post on here lol. I've always browsed random reddit forums including this one since I'm ethnically Sri Lankan Tamil but born and raised in Australia. My parents are first gen immigrants who are very quiet about their experiences during the war and they never told me anything except when I would keep probing because I was so curious.  (GUYS PLS do not downvote this post before reading all of this :) sorry it might be long cos I didn't plan this out).    **Edit: There's been almost 2000 lankans who have viewed this post but there has been very little interaction with this post. I understand the war will always be uncomfortable to talk about, but I hope u guys read my whole post and understand my perspective and that this post is purely for listening to different people's opinions and experiences on this topic and not to instigate any hatred or racism :)**

But at the same time I obviously don't want to bring up any trauma. I've heard bits about how soldiers would just take random Tamil guys with them because they believe (whether or not they have evidence, but I know with my dad they had none) they might have some information they could share. My dad was one of those men who was  taken away and they never really told me what happened to him during that time but there is clearly some trauma there. I also know that an uncle of mine was killed as he was in a bus that was bombed, by who I'm not sure, and I only found this out very recently because my parents NEVER talk about the war. Which I understand but I'm so curious to know. So naturally I went on my own deep dive.

But the more I view posts relating to the war, the more frustrated I get. I mean just recently I saw a Sri Lankan post ""Happy Victory Day"" or something like that and someone commented something along the lines of ""it's fine to be angry at the LTTE but we need to mourn the innocent Tamils who were also killed."" for some reason, all that some sinhala people have to say is ""come here and see how many Tamils we are living in harmony with"".

Don't u guys find this pathetic? I'm honestly so sick of it. Do some of u really need to deflect this way 24/7? Why are u guys so bad at facing the truth? **That both the government and the LTTE committed crimes? That,  whether u like it or not, u have to admit quite a lot of Sri Lankans continue to support and keep politicians in office who were involved in the discriminatory policies and laws that influenced the war to begin in the first place?**

I don't know, maybe it's because I'm in Australia, but we have so much more access to resources like textbooks from NON Sri Lankan authors about how badly Tamils were treated. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT SINHALA AND BUDDHIST PPL WERE ALSO KILLED. I HAVE nothing against sinhala ppl I'm literally friends with some here in aus. I've also been to Sri Lanka multiple times including a few months after the war ended as a baby because, like to many others, my parents were so desperate to reunite with their family and friends and to make sure everyone was okay. before ya'll come at me.  And apart from this one annoying Sinhala security personnel who would not let us enter a tourist place since we can only speak Tamil and so charged us as foreigners lol.....literally every other sinhala person I have met in Sri Lanka including in sinhala dominant areas was very sweet and friendly with us which always made our holidays so much more fun and easier.

okay final note cos I genuinely rlly want to know: what do u guys learn in school about the war, what's in your textbooks, is it taboo to talk about it, (I alr know generally ppl regardless of ethnicity or religion get along well now in Sri Lanka but I personally believe that this country will not be on the path of success if u just keep ignoring and avoiding the topic. ppl will always protest until they feel the government is genuinely putting in effort to hold ppl who committed war/human rights crimes accountable and actively give answers to families who had relatives killed or went missing in the war.

(guys I'm so sorry this is so long, but as an aussie it genuinely frustrates me. As u might know, Australia has a disgusting past with how colonisers killed, stole the children etc. of Aboriginal people. And that can never be undone. But it was recognised and is recognised today as a horrible part of our history and is openly discussed in schools nation wide. **I just wish Sri Lankans had the balls to face how they treated each other in the past and openly discuss what happened and how everyone was hurt. That's how u improve together as a community. Not the pathetic comments I see online of some of u guys having a go at each other and making fun of each other's relatives who were killed)**

IM SO SORRY THIS IS SO LONG BUT hopefully u guys will be interested enough in finishing this whole thing.

1f7uy70,With the popularity AKD is gaining why isn't anyone worried about another revolution/insurrection like in the 80s? Do you(or your family) have any (horror) stories from that period?,post,"Disclaimer: I don't support any political party, I think they're all shit and we have no good option. Also both the JVP and the government in did atrocious things during that time and in the end the only people that suffered the most were the common people.

Have people forgotten about it? I know it's not really taught in schools(it varies a lot from school to school).

I will share a personal story: both my parents suffered during that period. In my mum's case her older brothers were tortured by the SL army because they were suspected of being JVP, and one of them succumbed to his wounds and died(btw neither of them were affiliated with any political party). In my dad's case the JVP forcefully took his national ID and he was unable to do his Alevels on time(it was apparently common in their village). In both cases the ""leaders"" weren't directly responsible for any of the actions but all the pro JVP/NPP goons seem to want to take the law into their hands. In both cases they had to respect curfews imposed by the JVP at the time, no lights/candles allowed so no way to study for exams. They would also come into houses and steal food/dry rations. 

While I feel like we don't have an objectively good candidate, I think we have an objectively bad one. It's just sad to see how badly our people understand economics and just think that a certain party will magically increase their wages and take from the rich and give it to the poor.

I wrote this post because recently a bunch of AKD supporters had tried to share some brochures with my grandparents and when they were refused entry inside they had made threatening comments/allegations about how my grandparents stole money to build the house/their money belongs to the people and so on. 

The core message I'm trying to give is our people are lazy want free handouts but no political party can do that. They think that they can become well off by stealing from ""bad rich people"". 

Edit- adding this in because people seem to think I'm anti jvp/npp and pro ranil/sajith.

18p13cw,Oppression of LGBT Kids in local government schools.,post,"So, I (19M), go to one of those so called ""big colombo schools"". I don't wanna mention the name of my school because as much as I hate my school for all that it is doing to kids like me, this school still educated me close to 13 years, so I owe it to my school to not tarnish its name. Infact, may be its not even my school school that's at fault here, its the people who run it that ruin things for everyone. 

So a bit about about me (you can skip to para 4 for the core of the subject) For all my life, I've struggled with my sexuality.  Growing up I had no one around me to teach me about these things nor were any were they taught to me by the wreckage of an education system that we have in SL, but I knew something was ""not normal with me"", a feeling that young me struggled a lot with. But due to my conservative upbringing and the society around me I learned to suppress my true identity. 

But one day, I came across reddit (i saw one of my friends using it for memes so I decided to give it a go as well) but after awhile I came across subreddits like r/lgbt but most importantly r/SL where I learned that I'm not alone in my struggle, that there are so many people just like me from Sri Lanka itself who were looking for help/making rants and others in the community being supportive of them. This slowly started changing my perspective on things. I realised that its not my fault, but the fault of SL society in general. Our morally bankrupt ""culture"" and backward society breeds hatred, homophobia and a general dislike of anyone who isn't just like them. I learned about homosexuality, sexual minorities, pride etc. and it really gave me the courage to not suppress my real identity anymore and actually be true to myself for once. 

But that's all about me, what is more relevant here is my revelation that just like me, there are so many kids out there, in SL who are being told that they are weird and wrong and taught to suppress their true selves to fit into this bigoted society. I learned about how in western countries they teach kids about sexuality, hold awareness programmes and pride events. I wanted to do the same. I wanted to reach out to these kids and help them in their stuggles. 

I realised that I could take small steps starting from my school. My idea was to get a society official incorporated at school for LGBT kids by the name ""LGBTQ+ Student Association of X College"" to get things rolling for pride month next year. My initial idea was to start the society this year, reach out to kids within school in the early months next year, then find sponsors by June for pride month to be able to celebrate it next year and have our society day on pride day. I had great intentions and a well mapped out plan but Holy shit that is when I ran into the homophobic hells scape that is our school administration. Don't get me wrong, I knew there would be challenges but my school being in Colombo and having a crowd that is generally more liberal minded compared to the rest of the gov. schools, I really thought I could pull this off, but the events that followed were abosulety disgusting and sickening. 

My request to register the society was immediately turned down and a couple of days later me and my friend were called to the assistant principle's office. At the office she really brought out her inner Karen and gave us a lecture that is some of the worse homophibia I've ever faced in my life. We were told not to ""bring that nonsense into this school"" and that what were did was ""disgusting"". She assured that the kids at our school are not gay and didn't need out help and if we gave anymore trouble she'd ""do something serious"" and this was our first and last warning. I tied to reason with her but I was turned down everytime and made her scolding worse. My friend was just traumatised. If the word gets out to the principle's professional bootlickers that is the prefect guild, I'm as good as dead. I'm already heavily bullied and stuff so if they get some ammunition like that, they'd make school hell for me. 

I'm extremely sorry for the rant but I decided to write this here on SL reddit because I literally have no one understanding enough to vent about an issue like this. If I do, most of the people in my life I know would just make fun of me or bully me. Nobody understands my struggle but I've noticed that you guys here are generally more open minded and understanding than most conservative backward idiots in SL, so I hope you guys will bear with me. 

My question is what I can do at this point? Can the school actually do this? Is this even legal ? Can I take the Human Right's route? I'm sure there people in this sub that know about these things better than I do. I still don't wanna give up on my mission to reach out and help oppressed inncocent sexual minority kids but these bigots won't let me do anything. Its a whole a celebration all around the world using rainbow colours and flags and everything in June for pride but these conservative oppressors are still stuck with old and dated ideas still putting up buddhist flags for vesak or whatever. No wonder this country has been stuck in the same place for decades.

1mtoaht,King Parakramabahu (I) is better than King Dutugemunu,post,"Hot take: Sri Lankans glorify the wrong king.

King Parakramabahu did way more for the country, 
- massive irrigation works like the Parakrama Samudra (that still benefit us today), 
- reforms in governance, 
- attempts to unify the island, 
- and even overseas campaigns. 

He literally transformed the economy and agriculture. If we’re talking about who actually built the foundation for a stronger Lanka, it’s him.

Meanwhile, King Dutugemunu’s fame basically boils down to two things: 
1) defeating a Tamil king, and 
2) building stupas. 

That’s it. Yet he’s treated like the ultimate Sinhala hero. Let’s be honest, the obsession with Dutugemunu feels less about his real contributions and more about keeping alive a Sinhalese vs Tamil narrative. It’s almost like his legend is propped up to justify generations of ethnic superiority complexes.

So why does Dutugemunu get the hero worship while Parakramabahu, who was actually visionary, is often sidelined? Is it because religion + ethnic identity hits harder than actual nation-building?

Curious to hear people’s thoughts. Especially if you disagree.

1opo0rb,Reverted to Islam- what is my new identity?,post,"Hi guys! I have a somewhat unusual question and I’m unsure of how to handle it. So I am a guy from a Jaffna Tamil family raised in a Hindu environment but I have recently learned about the beauty of Islam. I had moved to Canada after the age of 10 with my family, and it is here that I was embraced by so many wonderful Muslims of various backgrounds in university and came to learn more about their faith. My parents are very supportive of my decision as they believe in the validity of all religions. However, a friend of mine had told me that if I were to fully revert, that I would no longer be considered a Tamil because Sri Lankan Muslims (Moors) are a unique community and are not Tamils according to official Sri Lankan regulations? Would I therefore be considered Moor now?

Growing up I guess I was surrounded by our typical Jaffna style cooking, clothing, language, etc and of course I am aware of the somewhat odd ways of how we Lankans classify ourselves. I have always considered myself as a Tamil person with a Sri Lankan nationality, but would this change if I reverted to my new faith that gives me so much peace? Would there be any issues with paperwork if I were to permanently return to my home country some day? Is there an exception to any documentation issues because Muslim people speak in Tamil? These issues of course will not impact my decision to change my religion, but I would like to know if this changes my ethnicity when in Sri Lanka",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1opo0rb/reverted_to_islam_what_is_my_new_identity/,1762398995.0

I wanted to share an experience my friend and I had at Kurumba Bay in Weligama, which left us feeling quite disheartened. We were enjoying our time at this beautiful location when the property manager approached our table. He inquired if we had ordered anything, despite the fact that we were already waiting for our food. What struck us was that he did not seem to ask the same question to other tourists around us.

It’s hard not to wonder if our appearance – being dark-skinned and dressed casually in shorts – influenced his decision to question us, while others were not subjected to the same scrutiny. This incident put a damper on our visit, as we felt singled out and unfairly treated.

We had looked forward to a pleasant day at one of Weligama’s lovely spots, but instead, we were left with a feeling of disappointment.

Honestly! ones lived through the decades, share your stories. 

That crippling fear of not being sure whether you would see your loved ones coming back home, may it be going to work or school. We lived in fear. 

I remember the final match between a rival country and our nation's lions telecast on local tv. Everybody tuned in. But I went to bed early,

But that day the sound I heard was different, not like crackers exploding In the distance, but had a deeper and profound sound. I got up and went to the tv lobby to check, if my family and friends were celebrating. 
Nope! They were outside, looking towards the sky.
Then it became apparent, the loud explosives were caused by AA guns, firing in to the night sky. Small lights were observed followed by the exploding sound I mentioned earlier.

Apparently, they were firing at the aircraft piloted by an terrorist. Fear quickly assimilated in our hearts,  electricity was cut off.

They are in fact the same as us, struggling with the rising costs of living and taxes in their home countries. The money they spend here are what they save up over a period of months and years, to enjoy a big break from their working life.

I wouldn’t recommend places here to any foreigner looking to visit, that have pretty much generally become tourist traps, which hasn’t been discussed at all on mainstream media even though we promote them “Ahhh, you should check out this and that place. It is a historic place. Cultural place. Proud Sri Lankan yada yada…”

You can call me a traitor all you want, say I’m against economic recovery and all that crap, but personally I’ll tell foreigners whom I meet (and that’s a lot) to stay the f away from mainstream places (plus being tourist traps) that charge exorbitant prices, scam them and charge locals next to nothing, while advertising discriminately in Sinhala and English their separate rates. This goes for many of historic, cultural and religious sites in disrepair, that the majority of us proudly announce our loud as our heritage. It’s disgusting and you don’t want your country to bow so low and develop on such criminal, vagrant means of income. 

This toxic tourist local culture, endorsed and nurtured at a administrative/government level over the last two decades has gotta be systematically dismantled. It has cultivated a very petty beggar mindset, often discriminating locals against anyone of slightly fair skinned nature. And our people sucking up and bowing down to people who are fairer skinned and doesn’t speak Sinhala/Tamil is a pretty sad sight.

I am gay male (30s) who cross dressed once - and discovered a whole new set of feelings and emotions and also a whole lot of questions. I would like to explore the topic and understand what my options are. But while I can find other cross dressers, I have found it impossible to find a person who has maybe done top surgery but has not done any changes to genitals. Where should i go (online or in person) to find a person or two - to build a friendship and begin to understand this whole thing. My work would not allow me to alter my appearance in a big way. It would really help if I could find someone who has had these experiences so I can have these conversations. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Any forum? Any site? Any org?

1jrvhb1,"Unpopular Opinion: Sinhala Acts as a Barrier to Global Awareness, and It’s Hurting Our Society",post,"I’ve been thinking a lot about how, despite Sri Lanka’s high literacy rate, our society doesn’t reflect that level of education in behavior. The rise in rape cases, sexual assaults, lack of civic sense (like littering in public spaces, urinating in the open, spitting betel juice everywhere, etc.), online identity theft, and the normalization of objectifying women all of this points to a deeper issue.

And I believe a significant part of the problem is our language barrier.

Sinhala is an isolated language, spoken almost exclusively within Sri Lanka. Because of this, a huge portion of our population is trapped in a toxic bubble, completely detached from global standards of behavior and ethics. Many don’t even realize that the things they say and do both online and offline would be considered completely unacceptable elsewhere. To them, this is just the norm.

I feel like alongside proper sex education and civic education, stronger English education is also essential to provide access to global knowledge and broader perspectives.

Thoughts on this ? 

Edit : Actually, my point wasn’t about glorifying English or seeking validation through it. My concern is that English is the most easily accessible gateway to global knowledge for our countrymen. The sheer volume of information, resources, and perspectives available in English far surpasses what we have in Sinhala, simply because Sinhala is a language spoken almost exclusively in Sri Lanka.

Because of this, many who only know Sinhala are effectively isolated from the broader world and end up seeing the social issues we face as “normal” simply because they have no exposure to alternative perspectives. This isn’t about morality being tied to a language, but about access to information. The ability to understand and engage with global discussions allows people to question societal norms rather than being trapped in an echo chamber where harmful behaviors are normalized.",54,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1jrvhb1/unpopular_opinion_sinhala_acts_as_a_barrier_to/,1743827760.0

But on the other hand, populist moves like the JVP raising government salaries in Sri Lanka might feel good for now, but they make the public sector even more bloated and inefficient. That kind of decision can hurt GDP and stop proper reforms.

Yes, JVP might be good at stopping corruption among politicians, but that’s only one part of the problem. The bigger issue is how much money the government wastes and how slow things are. If they don’t privatize loss-making companies and cut unnecessary spending, the whole system stays stuck.

There’s also no urgency. Projects under the BOI, infrastructure work, and even basic services take forever. Government workers don’t feel the pressure to deliver results. Instead of giving them lifelong jobs and salary increases, there should be real rules. If someone doesn’t perform, they should lose their job.

Even if JVP wants good governance and human rights, it won’t matter if they ignore the economic reality. Unions in some sectors have too much power—they stop work, block progress, and act like in old failed socialist systems.

This kind of control only brings stagnation, not growth. If JVP doesn’t take a stand against this and push for performance and efficiency, their economic plan will fail—no matter how good their intentions are.

In many Asian countries, a lot of successful businesspeople had to operate in grey areas because the system was broken. Corruption wasn’t by choice—it was survival. Now, groups like JVP are fighting corruption, but without fixing the system. So, honest businesses get scared they’ll be targeted unfairly.

As a result, they stop investing, shut down operations, and stay quiet until things settle. If there’s no balanced approach that also supports growth, this kind of crackdown will freeze the economy instead of fixing it.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ku3fqp/jvps_fall_is_certainthis_nation_chooses_progress/,1748061807.0

The weather is very pleasant with an average of 13-19c all throughout the year. And probably one of unpolluted cities in Sri Lanka with no sound pollution.

Many tech companies can position their offices here, as a way of bringing new people. Colombo is fucked up with so much traffic, tuktuks, bikes all crazy ass bus drivers. And not to mention the heat waves, that lead to all types of road-rages. The right municipal decision can make Nuwara Eliya a city with bicycles, and even try to bring in electric vehicles and etc. The quality of life is probably better compared to Colombo over time, as the new residents can build their own capitalistic city with: higher internet connections, cinemas, food courts, cafes. Over the time the government can use the tax collected to provide services within the city or even build online support systems so the residents don't have to visit Colombo for everything.

Right collaboration from a couple of big tech firms to bring their employees here will also support locals as their main income is tourism. A city full of extra activities such as hiking, golfing, wandering around in parks with great air quality.

Also if the country can provide the right quality of life, the people who want to move out, wouldn't really move out. Because why should they? If they can make good money, have a pleasant life here, why would they leave 10,000 miles away?? they won't. I understand that the government can't do shit, because they are 1. broke, 2. thieves.

Every year thousands of little boys and girls are forcibly circumcised by Muslim parents and nothing is done to punish these parents and physicians who cause such destruction to children. To see how circumcision destroys a person mentally and physically, below is an excerpt from an article published by Darcia F. Narvaez Ph.D in Psychology today,

**Psychological Effects on Infants**

**1. Circumcision Causes Immediate Harm**

**Circumcision is often performed on infants without anesthetic or with a local anesthetic that is ineffective at substantially reducing pain (Lander et al., 1997). In a study by Lander and colleagues (1997), a control group of infants who received no anesthesia was used as a baseline to measure the effectiveness of different types of anesthesia during circumcision. The control group babies were in so much pain—some began choking and one even had a seizure—they decided it was unethical to continue. It is important to also consider the effects of post-operative pain in circumcised infants (regardless of whether anesthesia is used), which is described as “severe” and “persistent” (Howard et al., 1994). In addition to pain, there are other negative physical outcomes including possible infection and death (Van Howe, 1997, 2004).**

&#x200B;

**2. Pain from Circumcision in Infancy Alters the Brain**

**Research has demonstrated the hormone cortisol, which is associated with stress and pain, spikes during circumcision (Talbert et al., 1976; Gunnar et al., 1981). Although some believe that babies “won’t remember” the pain, we now know that the body “remembers” as evidenced by studies which demonstrate that circumcised infants are more sensitive to pain later in life (Taddio et al., 1997). Research carried out using neonatal animals as a proxy to study the effects of pain on infants’ psychological development have found distinct behavioral patterns characterized by increased anxiety, altered pain sensitivity, hyperactivity, and attention problems (Anand & Scalzo, 2000). In another similar study, it was found that painful procedures in the neonatal period were associated with site-specific changes in the brain that have been found to be associated with mood disorders (Victoria et al., 2013).**

**3. Infant Circumcision has Psychological Consequences for Men**

**Over the last decade there has been a movement of men who were circumcised as infants and have articulated their anger and sadness over having their genitals modified without their consent. Goldman (1999) notes that shame and denial is one major factor that limits the number of men who publicly express this belief. Studies of men who were circumcised in infancy have found that some men experienced symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder, depression, anger, and intimacy problems that were directly associated with feelings about their circumcision (Boyle, 2002; Goldman, 1999; Hammond, 1999).**

&#x200B;

**Psychological Effects on Children and Adolescents**

**1. Medical Procedures in Childhood are Often Experienced as Traumatic**

**The CDC fails to consider that many medical procedures, even those that are described as routine, are often experienced as traumatic by children and adolescents (Levine & Kline, 2007). Circumcision, for example, clearly meets the clinical definition of trauma because it involves a violation of physical integrity. In fact, research has demonstrated that medical traumas in childhood and adolescence share many of the same psychological elements of childhood abuse, such as physical pain, fear, loss of control, and the perception that the event is a form of punishment (Nir, 1985; Shalev, 1993, Shopper, 1995).**

&#x200B;

**2. Procedures Involving Children’s Genitals Produce Negative Psychological Effects**

**The psychological consequences of medical procedures are even greater when they involve a child’s genitals. Studies have examined the psychological effects of medical photography of the genitals (Money, 1987), repeated genital examinations (Money, 1987), colposcopy (Shopper, 1995), cystscopy and catheterization (Shopper, 1995), voiding cystourethrogram (Goodman et al., 1990), and hypospadias repair (INSA, 1994). The studies found that these procedures often produce symptoms which are very similar to those of childhood sexual abuse, including dissociation and the development of a negative body image. The effects often persist into adulthood as evidenced by a study that examined the effects of childhood penile surgery for hypospadias. Men who had this surgery in childhood experienced more depressive symptoms, anxiety, and interpersonal difficulties than men who did not have the surgery (Berg & Berg, 1983).**

**3. Circumcision Causes Significant Psychological Harm in Children and Adolescents**

**Circumcision in childhood and adolescence has significant negative psychological consequences. Following a traumatic event, many children experience anxiety, depression, and anger; and many others try to avoid and suppress these painful feelings (Gil, 2006). In addition, children often experience a debilitating loss of control that negatively affects their ability to regulate emotions and make sense of the traumatic experience (Van der Kolk, 2005). In a study of adults circumcised in childhood, Hammond (1999) found that many men conceptualized their circumcision experience as an act of violence, mutilation, or sexual assault. Kennedy (1986) detailed the psychological effects of circumcision in a case study describing the psychotherapy of a boy who was circumcised at three years of age. The sense of inadequacy, feelings of victimization, and violent sexual fantasies experienced during this boy’s adolescence were found to be both consciously and unconsciously linked to his experience with losing part of his penis (Kennedy, 1986). In a study examining the psychological effects of circumcision on boys between four and seven years of age, Cansever (1965) used psychological testing to measure boys’ level of distress. The results of the study indicated that circumcision was perceived as an aggressive attack on the body that left children feeling damaged and mutilated (Cansever, 1968). Cansever (1968) also noted that these boys experienced changes in body image (with many feeling smaller and incomplete), feelings of inadequacy and helplessness, as well as a tendency to withdraw psychologically.**

&#x200B;

**4. The Majority of Boys Circumcised as Children and Adolescents Meet Diagnostic Criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**

**The most comprehensive study available that assesses the psychological impact of circumcision on children after infancy was conducted by Ramos and Boyle (2000) and involved 1072 pre-adolescent and adolescent boys who were circumcised in a hospital setting. Using an adapted version of a clinically established PTSD interview rating scale, the study’s authors determined that 51 percent of these boys met the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD and noted that other variables such as age at circumcision (pre-adolescence versus adolescence) and time elapsed since the procedure (months versus years) were not predictive of a PTSD diagnosis (Ramos & Boyle, 2000). As a point of comparison, the rate of PTSD among veterans of the Iraq war is approximately 20 percent (NIH, 2009).**

**5. By Encouraging Circumcision, Medical Professionals are Shaming Boys’ Bodies**

**If the CDC guidance is followed, medical providers will be communicating a psychologically damaging message to boys with intact genitals—that their penises are somehow “bad” or inferior. The negative effects of such communications have been studied with regard to intersex children and have been found to be frightening, shaming, and embarrassing to the child (Rusch et al., 2000). This is a particularly cruel message to send to adolescents, many of whom are already experiencing concerns regarding body image.**

Circumcision is a pseudoscientific lie propagated by Victorian doctors to suppress sexuality and violate the rights of children.

If we as a Srilankan society wants to protect the rights of children, then we should also say no to forced circumcision and make moves to ban this barbaric practice that has been practiced by certain societies in Srilanka.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/v3t2bg/fathima_ayishas_murder_and_hypocrisy_in_srilankan/,1654237313.0

1iuwd5g,My experience with the Late Mr. Harry Jayawardena,post,"I had the good fortune of working for Harry Jayawardena for 32 years. Now he is dead and gone; after seeing some comments in the YouTube videos, etc, I cannot believe how many people hate him. He is the opposite of what people think he is. He closely associated with all the politicians. Contrary to popular belief, he DID NOT get any favors from politicians. Probably due to his practice of not giving bribes to anyone, most politicians treated him and his companies horribly. 

First, he did not get any former state companies due to his political connections. As I was also involved in a few of the acquisitions, I will list how he grew his empire in the least 30 years in the most transparent manner and the hurdles he faced due to his reluctance to bribe.

1. in 1991, His first acquisition was Lanka Milk Foods, which was done by bidding in the CSE.

2. In 1992, his second acquisition was Distilleries Company, which he made by bidding the highest in the CSE. The company was valued at Rs. 30 a share, but it was reduced to Rs. 117 a share due to competitive bidding.

3. He bid at least 80% more than the second bidder to acquire the Ambewela and New Zealand Farms from the Livestock Board.

4. He acquired Balangoda Planations PLC and Madulsima Planations PLC by bidding in the auction through CSE.

5. Pelwatte Sugar was acquired through the CSE from Master Divers (. Mahinda Rajapakse, whom HJ knew from their youth, renationalized Pelwatte Sugar through an Act.)

6. In 1999, HJ acquired Aitken Spence by bidding in the stock market from other private investors.

8. In a globally publicized tender in 2003, he paid Rs. 6 billion for 90% of Sri Lanka Insurance. DFCC and the Commercial bank consortium (the second highest bidder) only bid Rs. 3.6 billion. After 6 years with Rajapakses' backing, the CJ entertained fundamental rights petitions (which, according to law, must be brought 30 days after the event) and reverted the SLIC to the government in 2009. 

  
9. Through SLIC, He bought shares of the then-Apollo hospitals in 2006.

  
10. In 2011, HJ also acquired Pelwatte Sugar from Master Divers in the CSE.

**I challenge anyone to give an example of a single entity he acquired through his political connections or other dishonorable means.**

**These are the political '*****favors*****' he received from his political friends, most of whom he had closely associated with for over 40 years.**

1. In 1998, Chandika imposed a massive import duty on the ethanol DCSL imported. He refused to buy the low-quality (smelly) ethanol from then-state-owned Pelwatte sugar. Anyone who knows the liquor industry knows that you have to be consistent with the taste of the liquor you produce, and the best way to ensure consistency is to have a known single supplier. This resulted in a 30% drop in sales of DCSL. While other producers continued to produce arrack using palette license spirits and sold at a lower price than DCSL, the government revenue dropped substantially as the other producers didn't pay the taxes on all their production (unlike DCSL)

2. In an era of smartphones, Lanka Bell became the only telecom company worldwide with only a fixed-line license. Mahinda blocked Lanka Bell from getting a mobile license in 2006 and gave the fifth license to AirTel. Since 2005, Lanka Bell has been begging for a mobile license as it is the only 100% Sri Lankan-owned company. (Even SLT is half-owned by Maxies of Malaysia.). HJ had to close down Lanka Bell with a loss of over Rs. 10 billion. Had the GOSL given Lanka Bell a mobile license, that could have saved significant amounts of foreign exchange remitted as profits by foreign-owned Dialog, Hutch, AirTell, Etisalat, etc., and 50% foreign-owned Sri Lanka Telecom.

In  
3. Mahinda and his cohorts used the then CJ to take over SLIC in 2009. Since 2003, he converted the state-owned SLIC to fight with Ceylinco and other competitors. He fulfilled all the conditions. The CJ found fault with the government's process but punished the new owners of SLIC and reverted it to the government. The government used Rs. 6 billion from 2003 to 2009, but the government has so far failed to pay the profits made or interest for that money.

**Ironically, Harry Jayawardene's actual behavior is the opposite of what people believe.**

His company, DCSL, pays the government approximately Rs. 100 billion annually in excise taxes. Like the competitors of DCSL, if he had taken 20% of his production out by bribing Excise Department personnel, he could have made Rs. 20 billion a year. For the 30 years he ran the DCSL, that value would have been Rs. 600 billion. Every drop of the spirits purchased is reconciled in the DCSL, and NOT A SINGLE BOTTLE leaves the factories without being accounted for Excise duty. For 30 years, he was at the helm, and not a cent was paid to any government office, including the excise department. 

Contrary to popular belief, he does not pay bribes, and he doesn't bribe politicians or government officials. This is why three of the companies he previously owned were taken back (SLIC, Pelwatte Sugar, and Appolo Hospitals), and he couldn't get a mobile license for Lanka Bell. However, his close friends Chandrka and Mahinda were present for 22 years.

He had one fault. He didn't handle the current communication scenario well. He believed that today's newspaper is tomorrow's waste paper. He never corrected the false narratives given in papers and people. He never showed his face or sought publicity when he gave money for social causes. I will give one example. There are approximately 9500 schools in Sri Lanka. He selected the lowest 3000 schools (1/3) and renovated them through Sri Lanka Insurance. Not a single advertisement or any article to get mileage was published. He spent money for six years (2003 to 2009) to clean and repaint 3100 of the poorest schools. Painted all furniture, etc.; this increased student attendance. 

He employed 44,000 people and shared the profits made by the companies through massive employee bonuses. He did a lot of good without seeking publicity and didn't correct false propaganda about him. Hence, the public hated him due to lies about him spread by interested parties. The people who worked for him loved him. Most of his companies had the lowest labor turnover, and it was common for more than 90% of the employees to work until retirement.

Asking because I’m trying to help out my gym buddy (20M). Dude looks great, good personality, not a player, and he’s working toward a solid career in the hotel industry.

I (29M) never really struggled with dating probably because I kinda check most of the usual boxes (Graduated from a prestigious uni, 6ft, good looking, Good physique + 6 packs, Good job and earn well). Not flexing, just saying.

But my buddy keeps striking out when it comes to serious relationships. Every girl he dates ends up leaving him for someone with more money, some wannabe rapper, or a biker dude 🤷‍♂️

What do you think he should focus on? Is this just an age thing, bad luck, or is he doing something wrong?

1l19pfm,What are your thoughts on this?,post,"As someone who frequently researches and reads about the Sri Lankan Civil War, I have learnt about many crimes and attacks throughout that period which resulted in the murders, tortures, sexual violence, enforced disappearances of all Sri Lankans of all background like Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim etc. I have also read up on the amount of discrimination prior to the war and the nationalism sentiment that continued to follow many Sri Lankans after the war resulting in the poor election decisions made. 

Despite this, some Sri Lankans still ridicule me and call me a LTTE sympathiser or a terrorist just because I am Tamil and I criticise the atrocities committed by the government. Even though I also criticise the war crimes committed by the LTTE too.

1l39eb6,"No, the Mods Aren’t Pro-LTTE, They’re Just Letting People Talk Honestly (please read the post and not just the title before commenting, and try to stay civil)",post,"There’ve been a few small Sri Lankan subreddits recently calling out the mods here for supposedly being ""pro-LTTE"" or having some kind of agenda. Honestly, I haven’t seen any real evidence of that.

People will post about LTTE atrocities, and somehow even that gets called biased. The truth is, any kind of extreme nationalism: whether it's pride in the army or glorifying the LTTE, ends up being divisive. Most of the time, it's just zombie-patriots from both sides looking to stir the pot.

It was a war. And war is never black and white. Horrible things happened on both sides. There are no clean hands in something like that.

**What’s not okay, and this goes beyond any one subreddit,  is hate speech. Reddit’s sitewide rules apply here too. Racism, homophobia, misogyny, transphobia - none of that should be tolerated. If people get banned for that, good. That’s not ""bias."" That’s basic moderation**.

And frankly, the mods here do their job. They remove the nonstop stream of low-effort content: vague relationship rants, ""should I text her back?"" posts, personal crises that could be answered with a Google search, or just nonsense. They're keeping the sub from becoming another landfill of lazy posts, and I respect that. My only (minor) gripe is when something gets removed for being ""off-topic"", which is subjective, but that’s a moderation call, not a conspiracy.

Now, anytime I see footage or stories from the war, I feel nothing but sadness. Regular people, with hopes, dreams, lives ahead of them, died because of the decisions of rich men and politicians who never once stepped on a battlefield. The people in Colombo, Kilinochchi, Delhi, D.C., Beijing, they made the moves, and young people paid the price.

Both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government committed atrocities. Both sides were backed by foreign powers when it suited their interests. Neither leadership was innocent. That’s just the uncomfortable truth.

And while it’s true that both communities need to hold their own accountable, as a Sinhala person, I’ll say this clearly: the responsibility falls first on us — the majority — to get our leaders to acknowledge what was done in our name. We have to start that conversation. And then, yes, the Tamil community must also push their leaders to confront their side of the history. That's how real healing begins, not by denying or excusing what happened, but by facing it.

**There are no winners in war. Only rich, powerful people making money off the suffering of the young. Everyone else loses.**

We should be like post-WWII Germany  own up to the crimes, teach them in school, stop pretending they didn’t happen. Not to shame individual soldiers, war changes people in ways most of us can’t understand, but to build a future where that kind of violence doesn’t repeat. Apologizing, teaching the truth, paying reparations where needed, that’s how a real nation grows.

This isn’t just about Sri Lanka. It goes all the way back to the colonial playbook: divide and rule. Create imbalance, elevate one group, frustrate another, and let it burn. The exact flavor of conflict was ours, but the recipe was classic British imperialism. We already had self-hate and division, so they didn’t have to try too hard.

So yeah — read both sides. Don't blindly follow anyone's narrative. Prabhakaran, the various Presidents — they all did good and evil, depending on who you ask. It’s messy. That’s the reality. It’s not a Marvel movie. There are no clean heroes or villains. Just a lot of pain, a lot of loss, and a long road to understanding.

1nw0u7t,Unsolicited thoughts on rave culture in Colombo,post,"I went to the previous edition of a rave in Colombo, a secret event that shall go unnamed to sniff out the politics of this particular dancefloor. With yet another event coming up in a few days, I thought I’d put out my unsolicited thoughts for anyone that may be interested. 

The venue, which transitions batches of the standard aspiring yuppie into tech bros and entrepreneurs for private equity by day, was surprising. EDIT: TIL that the same organisers have also hosted a rave at the Rio, following the precedent set by Pettah Interchange. Read more on the optics partying at such historically contested sites and the politics of art washing here: [https://tamilguardian.com/content/boiler-room-colombos-art-washing](https://tamilguardian.com/content/boiler-room-colombos-art-washing)

The organisers made grand statements that no illegal substances will be sold, and sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and racism will not be tolerated in their social media. One of the organisers shouted at the dance floor at the end of the night about how this event is a safe space for everyone. He also had a habit of shouting at the ravers chilling in the corridors of the venue, smoking and chatting as one does,”wtf are you doing out here?? Get your ass back to the dancefloor!!”

The organisers in general seem to have disrepute among the ravers in Colombo. Even on Grindr, the regular ravers were comfortable openly disparaging them.

https://preview.redd.it/3i63dr9aansf1.jpg?width=576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d47ae898c76778b1d00d4e9081a1aad74cb91074

The “birth” of techno music in Detroit in the 80s was a direct response to the resurgence of tension in the social fabric, particularly racism, deindustrialisation, urban decay, cultural exclusivity and decay. The music that came out of this to fill the cultural void in Detroit was experimental and sought to move beyond what disco music could offer to the dancefloor. Black youth repurposed technology as a way to imagine a future where they, and other marginalised people, could explore and mobilise their identities to build community. Techno is a form of afro-futurism that imagines a boundless society in a post-industrial wasteland. In the 90s, the second wave of artists explicitly used techno as a political act; they embraced a militant anti-corporate philosophy and pushed back against the whitewashing and commercialisation of the genre.

While I haven’t been to Berlin, I recently experienced many raves in Zurich and I got to learn the history of it from my people. Similar to Detroit, techno music reached a peak in Zurich in the 90s. With the cold war behind Europe, the dull city became an epicenter for hedonistic parties that began in disused industrial buildings and squats as a counter response to the conservative urban planning that had restrictive venue licensing laws. Ravers partied all night and well into the day defying official restrictions. The youth in Zurich sought new forms of freedom and self-expression after the crackdown of the open drug markets. Raves became a safe space for escapism, where organisers developed innovative practices, which we now have come to call “community based harm reduction” strategies, with drug checking at venues. The broader message of “love, freedom, generosity and tolerance” coalesced into a political movement that sought to incorporate conversations among the ravers about racism and homophobia in order to BUILD a safe space where it didn't exist.

And in today’s context, raving is just an ordinary thing that ordinary working class people did there; at the lake, in a nudist island, under a bridge, in a “forest,” in an abandoned building that we broke into etc. All you had to do was, go up these people and have a conversation with them — conversation about anything! The rise of neo-nazis, discriminatory immigration policies, rising islamophobia in the country, subcultures that you’ve seen but don't make sense, the evolution of rave culture, Palestine ✊🏽 anything you may be struggling with and need help with, ANYTHING goes! — and the next thing you know, they are sharing their shrooms and molly with you, and either dial up or dial down the music to meet you where YOU are. At this event event, you'd be lucky if you could find one person that had the backbone to hold any conversation! 🥱

These descriptions, while it may seem reductive and idealistic, to me marks techno as an inherently political act within the cultural space, where necessity drove cultural movements. They imagined futures and built infrastructure to counter social issues that the respective cities were experiencing. Necessity drove them to to innovate and liberate. In contrast, what are the social and political dynamics raves in Colombo are responding to? 

With the tickets priced at 4,000/=, a pill anywhere between 5,500/= to 8,000/=, and transport costing easily 2,000/=, one has to be prepared to drop about 15,000/= to party with the supposed “cool kids” of Colombo. Additionally, the organisers have explicitly banned wearing “Hawaiian shirts” at this rave, because “only the ‘chora’ crowd wear them” — meaning they do not want certain “types” of people participating in the space with them. These codes, implicitly serve to only exclude people — namely the working class. To me, this seems like an incorporation of Colombo’s exclusionary politics into the politics of these dancefloors, which seems antithetical to the history and politics of rave culture. Why are we so hell bent on keeping the working class out? 

While it is heartening to see queer people on the dance floor, expressing themselves, I found these dance floors to be extremely nihilistic. There is absolutely no romance on the dance floor, you don’t see anyone dancing with anyone, just with themselves indulging in their own trip. When I put myself back on that dancefloor, it felt like, the prevailing sentiment from the “outside” that was seeping in was — nothing matters; not me, not the person next to me, not our desires; the world is going to shit, it has gone to shit; I am shit; all that matters is that I am listening to this relentless, monotonous, industrial beat and boom 🙄🙄🙄 

Is it enough to just shout at the end of the event “no homophobia and sexism” at the end of the event without doing any of the leg work necessary? In a social setting where in-groups and out-groups are palpable, and when you don’t know whom to turn to if something went down, or when there aren’t people assigned and named to look out for when you need help, you don’t know who is protecting whom. This is just an extension of “cliques” that’s ubiquitous in Colombo’s social dynamics, where there is no opening for a stranger or a new person to feel safe, UNLESS you carefully fit their preconceived notions of how to be cool.

How did we get from illegal community centers to whatever tf this is?? To me, raves in Colombo have fully entered the simulacrum, superficially transposing simulations from the West onto Sri Lanka’s landscape and calling it ""the counter culture"" and ""the underground."" Here, underground represents a style and not substance. This is nothing but the commodification of rave culture, lifting the visual codes and aesthetics of the scene while stripping them of the context, politics and history of what necessitated them and placing it in Colombo's toxic social scene. This is liberalism infiltrating radicalism 🤢",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1nw0u7t/unsolicited_thoughts_on_rave_culture_in_colombo/,1759403436.0

BBS is not considered as a terrorist organization (they haven’t kill anyone) in Sri Lanka and mods here comparing it to LTTE and Islamic terrorists group who killed 250 people. We need to stop modding with how mods feel about something rather having clear evidence. BBS is not an illegal organization in Sri Lanka and even JVP killed more than them (yet no one banning their propaganda).

I am a layman trying to understand Sri Lanka’s complex history and would like to hear your perspectives. Please also share your ethnic background for context, if you’re comfortable.

Do you think the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) helped improve the standing of Tamils in Sri Lanka in the long run, despite the horrific scale of death and destruction during the civil war?

What, if anything, is different in the country’s political, social, or cultural dynamics today that can be directly or indirectly attributed to the LTTE?

Finally, how is the LTTE viewed by the Tamil minority today? Is there a divide between those who see the group as freedom fighters and those who consider their methods and consequences too extreme? I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts and insights.

Or just maybe do you believe only what aligns with your existing beliefs while rejecting anything that challenges them? Does it make you feel noble to be part of a movement that promises to ""change the system""?

Let me tell you something—you don’t know jack shit about what really happened back then. And to be fair, neither do I.

It boils my blood when doctors and engineers and other professionals who learned from these government institutions leave the country. 

My anger is not for them but against the governor which allows them to leave the country without taking any financial benefit from them. This is simply not logical.

These free education scheme  are supposed to improve the services provided by the country to it's citizens and they are treated as a golden ticket out of the country.

1iy16fx,Do you agree that Sri Lanka needs something like DODGE?,post,"It's frustrating to see how some people working short stints in government jobs can rack up huge loans and then seem to get away without repaying them, sometimes with these debts magically disappearing.  Meanwhile, the rest of us work hard, pay our taxes, and see our money potentially going towards these questionable practices.  It feels like some people are getting ""free money"" while we're left footing the bill.

It's not that everyone struggling in Sri Lanka chooses to be poor, but it does seem like some aren't even trying to improve their situation.  While many are working incredibly hard for modest salaries like 30k, others seem to be getting handouts for doing little to nothing.  The bloated government services only add to this feeling of inefficiency and unfairness.

When people claim that more taxes are the answer, it's hard not to be skeptical.  Why should we be penalized for working hard and using our skills?  It feels like we're being taxed to support a system that isn't working for everyone, almost like we're subsidizing condoms for others.  It just doesn't seem fair.

Haven’t seen any posts on pro Israel, maybe they are afraid of being condemned by pro-Palestine rants and labeled. We all here are mature enough to understand that there are always multiple sides for a story.

Just to play the devils advocate here on the issue should stir some thoughts for starters:

1. There is no outcry on the innocent hostages taken by Hamas. They are innocent people too.

2. Gaza didn’t stop its missile launches towards Israel even now. The missiles were launching from Rafah the whole time.

3. There was no Palestine before 1950s, it was a British colonial classification when they left the area. It was basically Arabs who live in that area.

4. If the whole world cares about the lives of Palestinians in Gaza, why hasn’t any of the neighboring countries take them in as refugees (Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia). Shouldn’t the world forcing these countries to take them in and save lives, knowing Israel is gone rogue.

5. Israel is conducting a military operation it attacks Hamas, and collaterally kills a lot of civilians. What hamas did on Oct 7 was deliberately killed civilians, raped women, microwaved babies (Ugly stuff). And was telecasting the invasion live in Palestine proudly.

6. Isn’t it double standard or hypocritical of us to make noise for the Palestine issue, rather than making the same noise here in Sri Lanka regarding corruption, human rights violations. Specific example here would be the up country plantation workers. Our fellow citizens who are treated like slaves. They would prefer to die immediately than this prolonged suffering generationally.

7. There is a man called the green prince, who is the son of one of the founders of Hamas. He who has seen and been in Hamas and also Israel tells what culture goes within the Hamas as an organization. That’s 1st hand information. He has already been saying this since 2014. And no one bats an eye. Atleast yet. Everyone should atleast listen to him once.

8. Kurdistan is a similar nation trying to be free from Turkey and Iran, they have their own government, population, culture, they’ve had elections themselves. Yet no one bats an eye. 

9. When the state of Israel was declared officially by the UN, the next day 5 surrounding countries attacked Israel. Israel won against all 5.

I’ll stop it here. Like to see countering points from all sides. I also like to see any corrections on the facts I’ve put up too.

 I wish this post and comments would end up being a good knowledge source for anyone who like to see Lankan perspective of the Israel Gaza issue even later years.

1. Are to have on the A/C on high at events and offices etc…
2. Preference for dark colours and even black!

And later we end up taking off our padded dark blazer/coat when you step outside into the blazing heat and wet monsoons, then take off the whole thing after coming home, put on baniyan and sarong at home - let it all hang.

I see foreigners come here and they actually wear more simpler, looser and convenient clothing for parties and events? Also I see the choice of material and colours vastly differ with the generations. Correct me if I’m wrong.

Btw I don’t have much experience wearing suits to parties and weddings, I just wear something comfortable and that causes less stress on my shoulders and body overall (but doesn’t mean the national dress either). 

I also think it’s such a bad idea to implement nationwide at an individual level (not community wide) and I just don’t see how it fits our tropical country and the whole history of modernisation (not westernisation mind you) of Sri Lanka. Like Japan and UAE have their own cultural work/cooperate attire, why can’t we have a unique modern identity like that in ours? 

True we are multiethnic and multi-religious, but white was more common back in the day, even among the Brits who lived here. And lighter khakis/whites + shorts for the military and police. Another good example is you still see Sri Lankan moors dressed traditionally too.

EDIT (MAJOR💋):
I need to emphasis the point of this post again:

It’s not about fashion, it’s about CLIMATE and your COMFORT. Western designs don’t always match other parts of the world. Look at Saudi and UAE… They sure as well don’t dress like that, cos they will die of heatstroke in that desert heat, once outside if they wear all of those black coats and all.

EDIT 2 💋💋:

Why don’t ya’ll understand basic science? Darker colours absorb more heat. Definitely not in this equatorial country where we don’t have a winter and we have heat waves + dust as of late.

First of all, the true patriots of this country strongly, yet sadly agree to the truth - because we always believe in facts unlike the fake news UNP, SJB and SLPP supporters, that RW's economic plan was one that was of great potential. I would have personally supported him if he did not support, protect and gain endorsements from corrupt crony politicians. Any true economists knows that if the govt is corrupt no matter how good the plan is the country will always be down in the dumps. Sri Lanka is a dump now but we are rising up.

  
Personally - the economic rise we are witnessing in the last few days (unemployment falling, resources being more efficiently allocated and the ruppee appreciating) is happening coz the govt operates well without corruption. Some pandits have told that these are the long term benefits of ranils plan. They are ture in a way, plan is good but it never worked while he was prez coz corruption minimises good economic results.

1. **Democratic** \- Most of the nations who use the word ""Democratic"" in their names are ironically some of the least democratic nations on Earth (Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea - 🇰🇵 , Democratic Republic of the Congo - 🇨🇩). This fact has actually become a running joke in regard to country names. Thus, I feel it's for the best to drop it from Sri Lanka's official name.
2. **Socialist** \- We are not a socialist nation, rather a hybrid of Capitalism and Socialism instead. The word ""Socialist"" also has a lot of stigma attached to it, and do we really need to be stigmatized by our nation's official name?

These posts are only semi serious and more of a meme. But I also saw a vloger from china make a post about how Chinese women are opting out of marriage because Chinese men allow their mothers to treat their wives badly. I'm starting to feel like this is a serious problem for marriages in South Asia.


So this got me thinking, we have a very high veneration of mother hood in our society, and when couples get married they can't really move into their own house and have to live with their in laws and so some times there must be conflict between the mother in law and wife. And I'm wondering if the husband is more likely to side with the mother due to the cultural value of the veneration of mother hood.

So also I'll ask the women if they see this so U feel like your husband takes your mother in law's side too often and do you think that Sri Lankan are mommy's boys.

1gv14hb,Today I Searched How Much sri lanka Owe to ever country and I was Shocked to Find Out how much it was to China ! ,post,"

Every** not ever

I decided to look up how much debt Sri Lanka owes   today, and honestly, I was shocked by what I found. The scale of it is unbelievable, and it all comes back to the choices made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

One of the biggest issues is the Hambantota Port deal. Back in 2007, Sri Lanka borrowed $1.3 billion from China to build the port. The problem is, the project didn’t bring in the returns it was supposed to. So, when Sri Lanka couldn’t pay back the loan, we ended up giving China control of the port for 99 years. Let that sink in—a vital piece of our nation’s assets is now under Chinese control.

Rajapaksa’s push to cozy up to China has left Sri Lanka drowning in debt, and the consequences are starting to show. Not only did we lose control over a strategic asset, but our relationship with neighboring countries like India has also taken a hit. China’s growing influence in Sri Lanka is seen as a threat by many, and we’ve ended up in the middle of a geopolitical struggle.

What really frustrates me is how poorly Sri Lanka’s diplomats handled all of this. It feels like the country’s leaders were either unaware or indifferent to the long-term impact of these deals. Now we’re left to pick up the pieces.

I really hope President Anura Kumara Dissanayake takes a close look at this situation. We need to rethink our approach to foreign policy and make sure Sri Lanka’s sovereignty and long-term stability come first. The country deserves leadership that will prioritize our future, not leaders who are willing to sell us out for short-term financial gain.

Mahinda Rajapaksa is not the savior of Sri Lanka .he’s the one who led us into this mess. It’s time for a change, and Sri Lanka needs a leader who will protect our future, not continue to sell us out.

I am a male, and I am 17, soon to turn 18. For most of my school life, I have kind of been a nerd. I was usually at the top of my class, and I was socially a bit behind my peers. Girls would think of me as 'cute' but that was about it. But after I was 15, I started to become more social, and put myself out there more. I still continued to be a top student, but I took part in a lot of extracurriculars, grew a social media folllowing, and became a sort of a 'popular guy' in addition to being good at studies. I started to receive more attention from girls, and even had a girlfriend for a while (we broke up because we turned lack chemistry). 

But my life sorta kept on improving (idk if that can be measured objectively, but I felt like it got better). I won the first place in a national level competition, took part in a few more, published a book, earned a decent amount of money for a 16 year old, became near-native in spoken english (I come from a sinhala-speaking school) and became an easily recognised person around the school. I recently had my birthday and possibly over a hundred wishes. It almost feels like too much. I am not exactly liked by everyone, there are a lot of people who hate me as well, but I definitely am well known. And looks-wise, I feel that I am a pretty attrative guy (not just me saying this, I get complimented on my profile pictures etc. a lot). 

The ironical thing is, it has become much harder for me to date, like near impossible. Every time I show interest in a girl, they end up feeling a bit intimidated (even when I try to be polite). I often get the 'seriously why would you like me you can do much better' line too. All of this eventually made me come to the conclusion that I wouldn't be able to date anyone in my school anymore. 

  
Is this normal? I feel a bit lonely tbh. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1fwiuow/does_dating_get_harder_when_your_life_improves/,1728104314.0

1ni91ck,Why is Sri Lanka so far behind other countries with the similar per capita in the same region (south asia and south east asia)?,post,"In terms of infrastructure, public transport and the use of digital payment methods, Sri Lanka lags far behind the peers. No metro, extremely poor bus services within the city and nearby suburbs, still cash payments for the tickets, damaged roads, etc. The adoption of digital transaction methods is also very low. The more cash that circulates in the society, higher the chances of corruption. It also makes it harder to bring more people under the tax structure to form an effective tax structure. The business people earning in millions are not paying tax, because of understated income that mostly comes in the form of cash, while salaried employees bear the burden. Yet, they still don’t get access to the basic facilities that could improve their quality of life.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1ni91ck/why_is_sri_lanka_so_far_behind_other_countries/,1758000701.0

The worst violence occurred in Gal Oya, where Sinhalese settlers and government employees used government vehicles, weapons, and dynamite to massacre Tamil civilians",post,"On June 6, a Sinhala mob of around 500 attacked peaceful Tamil Satyagrahis protesting the Sinhala Only Act, which made Sinhala the sole official language and excluded Tamil. The attack marked the beginning of a wave of anti-Tamil violence. In Colombo, Tamil civilians were assaulted, businesses were looted, and properties were burned. More than 100 Tamil-owned shops were ransacked, and many people were injured and hospitalized.

The violence intensified in Gal Oya starting June 11. Sinhalese mobs moved through the streets, targeting Tamil residents with organized assaults.

It’s bound to harm our image, or at the very least, impact the next generation when we’re supposed to be moving forward with the times.

I’ve tried talking to my younger family members, but they just laugh it off. Another time, when I brought it up with an adult who’s usually pretty informed, they shrugged it off, saying, “It’s not racist; we’re basically brown \*insert *N-word\* (s)*,” and that “criticizing it is just part of ‘woke culture.’”

yz9k6b,Ur view on:Political correctness in our English module/sliit,post,"I joined SLIIT recently and they teach political correctness in their English lectures( sem 1 lecture 10- english). Writing to the lecture in humanities faculty said that there is nothing political about political correctness.I asked how much marks it will carry and she said it will carry 20 marks in the exam . I am not too fond of institution trying to regulate my speech or language cause language is a part of our thought process and it seems to be in a way an attempt to tamper with my thoughts as well. I think I have spoken enough lets get into the rules and give me a comment on them 

Rules

**Rule one  - Use inclusive title when writing  a female name (ie Ms rather than Miss/Mrs)**

**I agreed with this rule but this rule isn't always applicable , they wants us to use Ms every time even when we know the marital status of the person.**

&#x200B;

**Rule 2 Recasting the Offending pronoun in the plural form**

A writer should use correct grammar in **his** writing . => replace **his** with **their** and **writer** with **writers .**

When asked if this is always a must they replied to me saying that if some uses his or him in a sentence they are being discriminatory. I replied with """" people even women in their essays may use a pronoun and I dont think they intend to be sexist , its just how they express the idea. Shouldn't we focus on the idea rather than the pronouns of a given academic journal or  research ."" They replied with we should care about both(idea and the pronouns used) and also said that I am suggesting to imagine that when someone writes or says a sentence like this it is not sexist. I replied I am suggesting not to imagine things

**Rule 3-8** 

  **Rewriting the affected noun**  

 **Replacing the offending pronoun with the definite article ‘the** 

 **Replacing the offending pronoun with the generic pronoun, ‘one’.** 

  **Eliminating the offending pronouns (Only if the original noun is plural** 

 **Rewriting using the relative pronoun ‘who’**

  **Rewording the sections where the offending pronouns are used**  

I pointed out this is the same rule as the 2nd rule with different ways of doing it.Also pointed out that all the examples given had the pronoun he him or his , so much for there ""inclusive"".(I cant post the slide here cause we arent allowed to share our lecture slides in public platforms, however I will link to the reading materials they have suggested us to use.

**Rule 9**

*  **Avoiding stereotypical nouns** 

 **Headmistress /headmaster - principal**

**Chairman -chairperson / chair** 

**Businessman – business person**

**Salesman /saleswoman - salesperson** 

I told them although man is included in the word chairman it doesn't mean it only includes men and also went on to mention that the chairman of our school was a woman as well. I then cited the dictionary meaning **"" a person chosen to preside over a meeting "".** They replied with it is sexist and ignored the meaning. Also yes they want us to use the word chair instead of chairman , I think  I dont have to comment on it.

*   **Inherently sexist words** 

**Mankind - humankind, people, humans**

**Man-Made-Synthetic, artificial, handmade, homemade**  

**The common man-the common/average person,ordinary people**

I cited the dictionary definitions as before and they repeatedly said it is sexist to use this words. Even with the definition I think the 3rd example is questionable but the problem is having the word man doesnt always mean its just about man ,when I presented this idea they replied with I am a sexist and if I knew how women were treated in the past and if I supported it. I replied with what does that have to do with anything and what does I have to do with that , I replied with a no and that I do not believe in the concept of father's sins if they arent being committed by me over again>!(they apparently didnt have problem with me not including women here,lol)!<

&#x200B;

* **Physical and or intellectual inability** 

 Blind musician -a   musician with a vision impairment 

 A disabled person  - special needs / differently abled person 

 Deaf - with hearing impairments 

No comments were added by me.for this rule . 

&#x200B;

Finally I also commented that there are certain guidelines to follow when you present a political ideology in a lecture like the arguments against it which is a standard followed by around the globe and a rule endorsed by the United Nations as well , the course coordinator replied that it has nothing to do with politics thus there is no need to represent the sexist ideas.(Maybe if they are so inclusive as they claimed,they would have followed the guidelines)

Again I cant upload the worksheets and lecture slides because it could lead them to take action against me.

I \*think\* I can see both sides of the argument as a mixed-race Lankan, but I am curious to know if Lankans in general would be averse to things as Hindi becoming an official language in addition to Sinhala, Tamil and English. Additionally, there is the high probability that the North and East will want to be a separate state of its own and split like how Telangana did (i dont particularly like it that the north and east are considered by some a 'tamil homeland' since Lanka has been the sole homeland of the islands inhabitants for millenia, nor do i like it that Tamils dont think it appropriate for Buddhists and Muslims to populate the North and East but I suppose that's a different topic for another day).

Read till the end to find out the entire story😊, So recently I had a few matches in Tinder. I’m a hetero guy so all the matches were girls. I got 4 matches within the last 2 months and actually hit it off well with one of them. We went on a few dates got a slightly serious but didn’t turn too serious and broke off on good terms. The other three ended the same, then not replying😂, but the way those conversations went is why I’m writing this because it’s just plain confusing. So with the match I went in a de dates with the main difference I realized was she was way more straightforward than the other three, she point blank asked me after a few texts why I was in the app and what I was looking for, I gave a straight answer and she said she was looking for the same thing. With the other three I got “Just seeing what happens”, “Here to make friends” and “I’m not really sure”. So I tried my same direct method with all of them. (This was at different times and no convos overlapped) So this is what I said to each of them: the first one, why are you on the app if you don’t know what you want? for the second, I have plenty of close male and female friends so I’m only looking for a relationship and the third was a question I was thinking about asking all three convos but only asked her, “Why are you swiping on me and wasting my time?” Sounds harsh but I am a person who knows exactly what I want. only the second knew what she wanted.

To make it more ironic, a graduation event was happening. Are we giving out degrees without teaching basic common sense?

I’ve seen this university hold countless protests and strikes. But where’s the discipline and respect for rules?

Some might say, “Not everyone’s like that,” but this isn’t new—I’ve been witnessing this for years.

Education without discipline is just a piece of paper. Many organizations suffer because of this mindset. 

And that’s why I had to speak up.

I know being gay has a spectrum. There are bro type guys ""straight passing"" on one end and feminine guys on the other end. So that's okay. 

But let's say I'm a little bit on the middle, some people never suspected I was gay, when I tell them they are surprised. But some straight guys definitely saw right through me. I don't play sports, neither do I drink. Never even atleast pretended to like a girl. Got a high pitch voice and my hands, they just move girly, no power in them. Feeling like a less of a man. 

I just want to survive. It's been very hard. 
How do I become more tough/macho? 
How do I make people listen to me and take me seriously?

1o149vf,Sri Lankan degree or migrate to Australia,post,"
I'm a (20f)year-old girl from Sri Lanka, an island near India. I completed my Advanced Level exams last year and have been selected to a well-reputed state university with a fully funded scholarship to pursue a *Bioscience degree majoring in Chemistry*. The entire degree is free.

However, my boyfriend (25m) lives in Australia and is currently doing his bachelor’s degree. I was planning to move there to study and be with him, even though it’s quite expensive. My parents are supportive and said they would try their best to help me cover the costs.

Now that I’ve been selected for this fully funded degree in Sri Lanka, many of my parents’ friends have advised me to *complete my bachelor’s here* and consider going to Australia for *postgraduate (master’s) studies*, especially since it’s becoming more difficult to migrate and settle in Australia.

So now I’m stuck between these questions 

1. *Go to Australia* now, be with my boyfriend, work part-time, and complete my bachelor’s there (with high costs).  
                   Or

 *Stay in Sri Lanka*, accept the free and valuable university degree, and consider Australia after four years for my masters

3.Is it possible to maintain a 4-year long-distance relationship?  

4.Does a Sri Lankan state university degree have value in Australia?  

5.Is it a good decision to complete my basic degree in my home country first?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1o149vf/sri_lankan_degree_or_migrate_to_australia/,1759909701.0

I also fully support the issue at Anuradhapura Hospital. Doctors do hard work, and their safety should be the responsibility of the hospital administration. Since all hospitals are directly managed by the Ministry of Health, this is ultimately a government responsibility. The concerns about their personal safety are valid, and I sincerely hope proper precautions are taken to ensure their security.

That being said, I can’t quite understand the extra privileges doctors seem to receive. Why do they get out of traffic fines, get preferential treatment in public or even private offices, pay less taxes, and have tailored insurance and utility packages?  I’m also confused about the absurd policy of offering free credit cards to doctors when the rest of us have to pay.

What’s the rationale behind these perks? They are treated as a cut above us. Why are we fostering a culture of special treatment, discounts, and handouts for doctors? This may even exacerbate this issue of an us vs them.

Here is the post [https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1m68raf/dreamplanner\_150k\_for\_6\_months\_internship/](https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1m68raf/dreamplanner_150k_for_6_months_internship/)

As you can see, the title and most of the comments there are overwhelmingly negative towards this product (or platform or whatever it is).

Basically the thread claims this product is a paid internship and commenters lose their minds about having paid to work.

I did some digging about this platform and to me it does not appear to be a paid internship at all. To me it looks like they are selling a course and mentoring. Then I took some time to check out who is behind it. A simple facebook or Google search would have been enough research but I doubt any of the commenters there bothered to check.

It seems to be built by quite a reputed team. One of the figures involved has been quite instrumental in SL startup ecosystem and women entrepreneurs for years. You can see a history of the webinars they did with industry figures in their Facebook page which is all public. You can also see public articles such as this: [https://www.lankabusinessnews.com/xpressjobs-and-dreamplanner-sign-strategic-mou-to-integrate-mentorship-and-career-platforms-empowering-the-next-generation-of-talent/](https://www.lankabusinessnews.com/xpressjobs-and-dreamplanner-sign-strategic-mou-to-integrate-mentorship-and-career-platforms-empowering-the-next-generation-of-talent/)

I know most of you here are A/L students or fresh grads and I understand you are pissed off at the current job market. But before you guys tarnish something for being a scam or a paid internship or being too expensive, do your research and verify the facts. Otherwise you may be ruining someone's hard work for some internet points and validation.

I'm not vouching for this platform as I have no personal experience of using it. The point I'm trying to raise is blasting such a product in public without researching any facts is quite irresponsible.

This is not the first time I see this on SL Reddit. I've seen brigading posts about businesses/brands/people here quite often.

1m3l765,Feeling hurt by how @tharushiran whitewashes Sri Lankan history and silences people who speak up,post,"**EDIT: I ADDED EXTRA EXPLANATION FOR QS PPL HAVE ASKED PERSONALLY AT THE BOTTOM**

Hi everyone,  
There’s a TikTok creator, u/tharushiran, who’s gained a big following by celebrating her Sri Lankan Sinhalese identity and the beauty of the island. I genuinely support people sharing pride in their culture. I think it’s important, and I’ve always felt it’s great when Sri Lankans, especially in the diaspora, promote the country in a positive light. I’m not against that at all.

But there was one video she made that really upset me. In it, she celebrated Sri Lanka being named one of the most desirable islands in the world, which is a proud moment, but then she said that **Sri Lanka is considered one of the friendliest countries because it’s a Buddhist-majority country.**

As someone from a minority background, that hurt. I’m not saying Buddhism itself is bad - in fact, it teaches beautiful values. But in Sri Lanka’s context, linking friendliness to being Buddhist felt like it erased the many people - **Tamils, Muslims, Christians, and others** \- who have also contributed to the country’s warmth, despite decades of discrimination and violence, often tied to Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism.

Even worse, when people (myself included) respectfully pointed this out, that it might come across as insensitive or erasing minority experiences, we were **blocked**. Not just one or two of us. Several of my Tamil and Muslim friends were blocked after leaving calm, honest comments or messages. I even replied to a **racist bot account** that regularly posts hate on Tamil creators’ videos, I flagged it to her politely, suggesting she might want to block it.  
Instead, **she blocked me.**  
But the racist account? Still commenting freely under her videos.

It left me feeling **hurt, silenced, and invisible**. Like we should only be talking about the good parts of Sri Lankan history. And all we were doing was trying to start a conversation.

I’m not here to attack her. I’m not trying to start drama or divide people. I’m sharing this because I believe we can only move forward as a community if we’re **willing to have honest conversations**. Even when they’re uncomfortable.

I want to ask, genuinely and respectfully

* Have others noticed this kind of one-sided narrative in diaspora spaces?
* Can we celebrate Sri Lanka’s beauty without ignoring its complexity?
* How do we create space for *all* Sri Lankans, not just those who fit a certain image?

I really hope people from all backgrounds (Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher)feel welcome to share their thoughts. I’m open to hearing different perspectives. I just want to feel like our stories matter too.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. (Also I feel like Sri Lankans rlly need to better think about which influencer they would like to blow up on the platform because idk personally I find quite a few of them offputting).

**EDITS, (sry super long but cbb to edit)**

**1. The reason why I made this post a few weeks after that Tiktok post she made is because I found out 3 of my other friends also experienced a similar experience with this creator. Like I said, I replied to one of those racist bot accounts that always comment racist shit on Sri Lankan people's posts telling her that person is a known racist bot account that she should block. But instead she blocked me. I was annoyed by that but brushed it off as her accidentally blocking me while going through her comment section to block people who made hate comments. I brought it up now because I recently had a discussion with my friends about who our favourite Sri Lankan social media creators were. I remembered how I got blocked by this girl and brought it up to my friends.** 

**Turns out, three of my friends experienced something similar with this girl. They had also commented on that post telling her how what she said about Sri Lanka being ranked as one of the most friendliest countries is because it is a majority Buddhist country is such a weird comment to make, especially since we all know Sri Lanka has a bad history when it comes to ethnic and religious violence.** 

**So they commented things like ""You should be more careful with how you word your opinions because Sri Lanka being a majority Buddhist country doesn't make it more friendly"" and they got blocked. And that's when I decided to make a post about it on here because she seems to be blocking people who express concerns about how that post can come across as insensitive and ignorant to minorities.** 

**I really cannot think of a logical explanation as to why she would block people who made those comments and it seems like no one else under this post has figured out why either.**

**2. I know she made a comment herself in the comment section of that post saying that Sri Lankans of all backgrounds contributed to it being voted as the most friendliest island or whatever it was. But then why is she actively blocking people commenting actual concerns about her poor choice of saying that it being a Buddhist majority country is a contributing reason to that?** 

**Her actions don't match up to her words.**

**3. I didn't ask you guys to go bully this girl. I'm surprised that this post even got this much interaction since I thought it might be too much of a niche topic. From both my and my friends' experiences with this girl, I was weirded out by this person's behaviour and what her intentions must be to be blocking people who expressed concern about how that post was disrespectful to minorities. I would ask her myself but I can't since we all got blocked for no reason. So I came on here to ask and to also see if any of u guys experienced something similar, which turns out another person did.**

**4. Knowing now that my friends got blocked as well just because they commented concerns about how ignorant that comment was to minorities, I'm kind of over her fake facade of ""Wow, we are such peaceful, beautiful people"" while she's actively blocking people who don't agree with everything she says. And yeah ik, some of u guys messaged me letting me know she disabled her comment section on her most recent post cos most of the Sri Lankans' were disagreeing with her. I just don't understand how she wants to be this beacon of Sri Lankan pride while also blocking anyone who doesn't agree with her.**

1htyisz,Fear of Another Pandemic 😑,post,"I just started getting my life back on track after the coronavirus pandemic. I passed my A level exams, but the things we faced during that time were awful. I don’t even want to remember them. I was really happy that things were finally starting to get better. I got selected for university, and after years of struggle, life was just beginning to feel normal again.

But this news about virus freaked me out. I’m scared that it will cause another pandemic. I don’t know how to explain my feelings, but I’m really afraid. All I want is a normal five years to fix my damn life. If there’s another pandemic, I’m pretty sure I won’t handle it. I’ll give up all my dreams and goals for a fucking job.

xzo92a,Virginity and Sri Lankans,post,"As far as we know virginity is a key factor for Sri Lankan peeps when it comes to relationships. Mostly guys do prefer girls with minimal to zero sexual experiences and girls tend to stay virgin as much as possible. 

Ive been overseas for sometimes and pretty much SL girls who lives abroad pretty much dont care about virginity and those who lives here seems to have care about that so seriously. 

And most of the time all this matters untill the first intercourse and then start the fwb, ons, cheating and list goes on.

My question goes to girls and boys separately.

To Girls: Majority of you having sexual encounters like from giving head to back door access at least with 1 guy prior to the marriage and consider you as a virgin cuz you didn't had the intercourse. And what made you stay away from having sex? Is it because you feel like the next guy think less of you or reject you or it it genuine cultural influence you have?

To Boys: it is rare to find a guy who didn't had sex (including paid) prior to the marriage and yet guys expect a pure girl to marry. Yet guys are the ones who sufferers from the sexual frustration most since girls can have sex whomever they wont and guys have to fight. So do you think that guys are the main reasons for this frustration cuz we are the ones who expecting girls to be pure and they just provide what we expect.

1akzisg,Is it bad that I think Ranil should get a 2nd Term?,post,"I know this is an unpopular opinion. And I have never voted for him in my entire life. but when I look at all the other options for the upcoming presidential election, none of the candidates makes me believe in them.I think **Sajith** is a lunatic, I don't trust anyone who will be endorsed by **Mahinda**. And **Anura** looks like a good candidate but I'm afraid he might turn out to be a good talker but not a good dooer. And i don't trust some of the economic policies will work.

On the other hand, Ranil took on the presidency at a challenging time but I think he has done an okayish job so far. I think he could have done much better but without the power in parliament, I guess his hands are tied.

but I've been out of the country for the last year so I don't know the ground situation other than what I hear from my relatives & friends. so I'm not sure either.  I just want to know your opinion that's all.  


edit-  
Damn, I didn't think this will fire up like this. But thanks for everyone's opinion that's what I was really for, but since some of you are focused on attacking me rather than voicing your opinions here are some facts. 

&#x200B;

1.  I believe Ranil might be somewhat corrupt & He got the presidency with the support of Rajapakhsa's. I simply think out of all the options we have, he is the slightly better option. Note the work **slightly** better. 
2. I'm not some rich asshole who's abroad with my parent's money. I may be slightly better off now but I'm from an average middle-class family & most of my friends & family are the same. 
3. I believe its easy to just follow IMF & other stakeholders but we were in dire situations we could have easily been another Argentina or Zimbabwe but Ranil managed to somehow steady the ship somewhat but we are not out of the woods yet. So I would rather have him take us the rest of the way than someone trying to **change the system** again.  

4. Also, I'm not going to argue with everyone who has a different opinion than mine, I'm entitled to my opinion and you are entitled to yours. I'm sure just like me you also think that's the best for the country now. This is my opinion looking at how things were and how things are now, believe me, I could and I will change if I believe things are different or I'm misinformed.

1m73az0,Lankan money hoarding attitude is silently ruining the economy,post,"I've noticed a common pattern among many Sri Lankan middle- and lower-middle-income households: a strong tendency to **hoard money**, either in bank accounts or physically, rather than circulate it. Outwardly, these families may appear to be struggling—living in modest homes, owning just a tuk-tuk or motorbike, and maintaining a minimal lifestyle. But behind the scenes, they often have **substantial savings** tucked away.

In contrast, **Western cultures tend to treat money as something to keep moving**—spending, upgrading, reinvesting. This can create a “rat race” mentality, yes, with its own problems like overworking and constant financial pressure. But that approach keeps money **flowing through society**, boosting living standards and supporting economic growth. People work, earn, and spend — and that **cycle keeps the economy alive**.

When large segments of society choose to **sit on their money**, it creates a kind of **artificial scarcity**. Money exists, but it’s not circulating. Small businesses struggle, people have fewer ways to earn, and the economy slows down. Eventually, the government is forced to step in—through foreign loans or printing more money—to compensate for the lack of liquidity. And that, in turn, **devalues the very money people were trying to protect** through saving.

Meanwhile, banks use this hoarded money to fund **large-scale investments**, usually benefiting those already wealthy. So the poor remain stuck, the middle class appears poor despite their savings, and the rich continue to gain through strategic investments. **Wealth becomes even more concentrated**, and upward mobility becomes harder.

The problem here isn’t just bad governance—it’s also a collective mindset. People often blame the system when things go wrong, but **the everyday choices we all make around money—especially when repeated across millions—shape the economy too**. Saving money is responsible, yes. But saving without circulation or reinvestment is a silent contributor to stagnation.

I feel like their is a lot of attitude changes of people like this that needs to be addressed cuz the moment lankas economy falls or gets a hit, they blame the government. Nah i think we all share the blame and for most people thats hard to digest.

Does this make sense?

PS: I used chatgpt to rephrase some of what I wrote down so its more easier and straightforward

EDIT : I appreciate everyone's take on this. Primary reason I put this on reddit is to learn more of whether it makes sense or not and I asked that question on this post. Some of you with far more knowledge than me about these matters said some really sensible things whether you agreed with me or not and I appreciate that.

1c24h17,I'm 20M and feeling like loosing a part of my life(really need you guys advices ),post," 

I'm a 20-year-old male, and I've been single for about three years(please dont stop reading after this line lol) During this time, I've been focused on my AL's and freelancing stuff, I took online classes for all subjects which may be the reason I haven't met any new girls. I only know few female friends from my school days like 2-3 literally.

Currently, I feel like I've got my life together in terms of education and money stuff(not 100% at all but for my age i think am at a great level) now I really want to find love man, and I'm not sure how to go about it. I work from home, and the gym is the only place I regularly go outside. So, I'm wondering where I can meet girls. Maybe i could meet in uni but still have like 1 year to go. also most uni girls in relationships right? so  I worry that I might have missed out on this aspect of life. I apologize if this sounds cringy.

and i feel like I'm not very masculine, but I'm actively working on improving myself. I often fear that I'll end up being just another ''proposal guy'' I've been watching videos on YouTube, like Jordan Peterson's podcasts and other self-improvement content, but I'm not sure if their advice is applicable to Sri Lankan girls.

I'm reaching out for advice because I feel like you might have more life experience than me. I previously posted about this on a Elakiri forum, but people started making jokes, which really got to me. The idea of being labeled as a 'proposal guy' is particularly painful. I know its not a bad but i wanna find a love,''m sorry if this post seems silly.""  Can you guys give me some advice or whatever comes to your mind? Please comment.

Many ambitions were doomed to dust. My Mother was studying to be a lawyer but due to the situation then, Grandpa was worried and had convinced her to change her path.

How many such dreams might have been abandoned?

JVP also seems to have this regressive anti-English mentality.

Particularly in state unis.

I remember I was hanging out with this person and his friends who were state uni students and I remember something that my brother said in English, to which he said admonished;

""Hey, no English here!""

Now, I don't mean to look down on Sinhala and place English on a pedestal.

It's just that, English has the most market demand and has established itself firmly on a global scale.

Shunning English means, shunning the opportunities that come along with it.

Like Rajapakses survived on racist propaganda, JVP seems to have survived on class politics and shunning educated individuals.

u2y3mu,WHY GOTA WILL STAY PUT…,post,"Credit to unknown OP

The protests around the country, which started ten days ago on April 3, have now concentrated on Galle Face.  The original crowds have fizzled down to a ‘carnival in the rain’ atmosphere. The much-needed anger, the baring of fangs, is no longer there in the crowd. The Colombo middle class, with all its western pretentiousness, is there in jeans, shorts, sandals and bandanas. The protest has turned from a short-lived dynamic countrywide mass uprising down to a 'middle-class rap over the knuckles' affair in Colombo.  And the Rajapaksa advisors and minders are watching from the Presidential office windows and from the Shangri-La with a sigh of relief. They sense the threat is dissipating. With some emergency assistance from India, and perhaps China, in the coming weeks, the most telling wants of the people would be met. The anger at the hardships of the past months would be abated.  And the people will accept the new conditions even though the wellbeing of the country is nowhere near what it was a couple of years back.

China and India both want the Rajapaksas to remain at the helm.  It is easier to deal with corrupt leaders whose interests are limited to amassing wealth for themselves than with a new leadership bent on rooting out corruption and doing good for the people. With Rajapaksas, both India and China know that they can cut out the island to satisfy their own geostrategic needs – to keep Sri Lanka as the shared harlot of these two great powers.  An alternative like the NPP/JVP, who has no other objective than to do the best for the people, would spell disaster for geopolitical ambitions of these two “friendly” countries. 

 

The initial public outrage was diffused by the cabinet resigning.  It was a smart move by the Rajapaksas. Now there is a lull.  The Rajapaksas have thrown a bone to the opposition, in that, the offer of a “national cabinet”.  And the individual opposition members, each with his own selfish ambitions for power, would be in a dog fight. Eventually, in a compromise, the Rajapaksas will have their stooges in any new cabinet to ensure and protect the Rajapaksa loot and to guarantee the prospects of a Rajapaksa dynasty to recommence when the dust settles – the ‘Namal 2030’ Project.  Ranil, as before, would be their point man with Sajith (leading the SJB) playing the second fiddle in this tragedy. Anura Kumara and the NPP/JVP will continue to keep barking but without having teeth to bite.

Gota will not go home.  He will stay put, quietly.  He will see out his term and fade into history. Gota’s many friends who made their corrupt billions under him, will look after Gota, and his family’s desires, until kingdom come.  And, eventually, when Gota dies, there will be a full military funeral with people weeping openly. And so too when the elder brother dies.  People will line up for miles to go past his coffin. And the stolen billions, the murders, the white van abductions, the disappearances, the Easter Bombing, the ruination of the island’s economy and the civil society and all the other corruption?  Forget it.

 

Just remember that Bongbong Marcos, the son of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos who stole billions from the poor Filipinos, is still politically powerful in the Philippines; their families live in super luxury. Bongbong is a senator and possibly a future president.  So, Namal Rajapaksa, dear boy, please note and don’t be disheartened by the current situation.  You can have the cake and eat it too; your time will come. Also remember, Namal, that Benazir Bhutto and her husband, Ali Zadari, stole billions (estimated at $1.5 billion) and stashed it in Switzerland, got out scot-free even when exposed comprehensively.  And Ali Zadari is still calling the shots in Pakistan; Benazir would have been president had she not been shot. Same story with the Suharto dynasty, the Hosni Mubarak dynasty and so many other corrupt leaders around the world.  Namal, my son, corruption, yours and your family’s, is not going to stand in your way.  As long as you have people around you who can control the 6.9 million baiyas and their descendants, you will undoubtedly reach the pinnacle one day. 2030 your target? You’ll get there; no worries about that.

The above straying from the theme is to show that the Rajapaksas are not “done” as yet.  Nor will they ever be. But why?

 

Two reasons.  The first is that the Rajapaksas were able to create a feudalistic vassal class, a mass of “ambattayas”, to see them (the Rajapaksas) as the redeemers of the proud Sinhala-Buddhist heritage in the island.  The second reason is that a majority of Sinhala Buddhists are culturally conditioned to accept the injustice and corruption of their rulers – a crucial part of the feudal mindset.

 

The Rajapaksas, especially Mahinda, know this very well.  All they need to do now is to sit out this crisis, to have patience and not panic.  Yes, for sure send the families overseas, just as a precautionary measure. Yes, send out those minding the family loot overseas too – for they have to be safe to draw out the stolen money to spend on any fightback.  But the father, sons and uncles have to stay put.  And let the Colombo based bourgeoisie steam off on Galle Face. And, for as long as they like. 

 

So long as the rural masses are quiet, the farmer and the village monk; so long as the war “victory” can be marketed; so long as the “perils” the Sinhala Buddhists face can be promoted; there is no real threat to the Rajapaksas.  The Rajapaksa supporting silent majority will have their say at the ballot box. That base has not woken up; they are too deep in the cesspool of archaic beliefs, astrology, occult, tribalism and the quasi-religious phenomenon known as “Sinhala-Buddhism”.  To wake up from this grip there needs to be a massive cultural change.  That is not happening.  And, as long as the masses are held in these quasi-religious and supernatural grasps, in this tribalistic mindset, along with the imagined past greatness, there is not going to be any true awakening.

 The “Middle-class” coming to the Green is a good omen for the Rajapaksa.  And so too is the visible presence of Muslims.  Without uttering a word, the regime recast the protest as a “Colombo westernized elite” driven initiative and backed by the minorities.  If possible, say it is a CIA plot too.

 

So, what would be the ultimate outcome.  Gota will continue as president.  Mahinda (or his proxy) will be in any national cabinet.  So would Ranil, so would Sajith. Some losers in parliament will grumble; others will protest.  But to no avail.

 

And the old caravan will continue on…..

1fjxvrd,Don't go to this Pyschatrist she is overdosing kids and people with pyschatrist meds than needed.,post,"**Awareness post ,about a so called famous pyschatrist** Dr. Swarna Wijethunga.

( Prescription attached as image below)

**Do not go to this pyschatrist this prescription shows proof of how she is over dosing people and prescribing anti-psychotics to normal people. My friend who has anxiety due to exam stress ( A/L) was prescribed** Quetiapine. I am not a doctor and what I know on psychiatry is very less, but from the little I know, anti-psychotics are medicines that acts on central nervous system and change brain chemistry, so it must not be prescribed unless someone really needs them.

**Psychiatric medication must be started on the lowest possible dose, and see if body shows a reaction for the lowest dose and slowly up it and stay on the dose that helps. My friend was earlier prescribed Citalopram by her, and that also had sedating effects. She told the doctor, citalopram made her feel happy but sleepy, that's the whole reason she went to get a new medication, and said pharmacist suggested Escipatloram ( Nexito) , which is the more purer version of citalopram with no sedating effects, but after my friend said pharmacist suggested, she cut it off and wrote an anti psychotic, and has told her escipatloram makes people sleepy than citalopram ( which is totally wrong information). And told she had Mania when taking SSRI. Being happy is not equal to mania, and how could she come to a conclusion its mania in 5 minutes.**

**Sadly she is a child pyschatrist and most of her patients is pediatric population and its so sad to see the young brains being over dosed, at a stage where neurons make new connections.**

**Another over prescribing doctor is,**

**Doctor Chaturie suraweera ( Gave me 150mg sertraline, 2.5mg olapanzine ( an anti pyschotic) for no reason, so be careful.**

**Doctors love giving cocktails of medicines.**

And when only 60 days for A/L, that medicine will sedate and put her to sleep as Quetiapine is a top choice by doctors to treat insomnia. Didn't Dr. Swarna even bother thinking, this kid needs to study, and passing exam well is essential as anxiety will be reduce or gone away with doing exam well, but instead she gave a medicine to put her to sleep.

1gxsq7j,need advises on dating in Sri Lanka for sexual minority ,post,"how to find a partner in sri lanka as  transgender men ( female to male) ? 

Also I have another question. how to find a professional and safe platform for transgender men to propose women in sri lanka? 



Its really difficult to find a platform to post a proposal. I think mangala kinkini and all the other sri lankan proposal platforms arent friendly with transgender topic. I tried to use lgbt dating apps but they are already fkd up with weird cisgender straight men who tend to use lgbt individuals for their secret sexual fantasies. you may don't believe it but they are full of married cisgender straight men looking for cute teen boys and transgender people for secret sexual relationships to satisfy their silly needs. yes hard to believe it. many people said they are straight and they just wanted a hole  to use part time without knowing their GF or wife in real life. and all the lesbian profiles were just fake men.this is annoying.

sometimes LGBT only platforms are not successful for transgender men. because most of transgender men (including me) prefer dating cisgender straight women.  so no cisgender women reach lgbt platforms. 

I think trying foreign platforms is also not successful. because their lgbt communities are totally different from ours. most of us can successfully blend with cisgender people and we can live without being much complicated. when I see foreign lgbt communities its not in that way. 

in my real life I have a fear to ask out girls. its not because of a personality problem. its just because I have a fear of getting exposed to transphobic people. because in my real life no body believes that Im transgender. I have a passable appearance.  but I have a toxic experience. my first Gf just used me for fulfill her needs.  and started a guy who was selected for engineering at the first attempt in ALs. its okay to select someone if she is not okay with me. but she cheated on me while using me. If she said that she is not okay with me i'd definitely let her go. As Im a very independent person I wont beg anyone to love me. but she kept cheating on me. I dont know why. not only that later she has told that im trans sexual with everyone both of us know. its really shocking and I got away from my home town. actually southern people are really narrow minded and not good to expose as a transgender person in south. I was discriminated in several ways up to throwing paper balls at me in mass classes. so at that time I was unable to focus on studies. I still hate southern people. they make me to have severe depression for few years. now im living in another city far away from southern hell. but no body here knows my sexuality. I dont want it to be revealed to annoying people. so thats why im afraid to approach  girls. 

I seek some advises from you.

so how to find a cis woman okay with dating someone like me? how to make sure that they aren't cheating on me?

is there any safe professional platform for us to date someone or propose? ",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1gxsq7j/need_advises_on_dating_in_sri_lanka_for_sexual/,1732340913.0
vnl0hy,Are there anti-religious movements in Sri Lanka against Buddhism?,post,"Hello everyone.

I am from India. I was wondering: are there anti-Buddhist movements in Sri Lanka that call out Buddhist beliefs as nothing but superstition? I am not talking about attacks by other religious followers, but by rationalists or anti-religious people (I guess ""anti-theists"" wouldn't be the right term in the context of Buddhism).

Asking this because I think that religion and superstitions aren't attacked enough in India for nationalistic reasons, and I was wondering whether the same situation holds true in Sri Lanka as well.

I have a much more favorable view of Buddhism than I have of my own supposed religion, but that may be merely due to my exposure to it in the forms as interpreted by the West.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/vnl0hy/are_there_antireligious_movements_in_sri_lanka/,1656523102.0

zbyz6d,"What are your thoughts on compulsory military service as a solution for combating ""brain drain"" and building national solidarity within Sri Lanka?",post,"Boomers love to compare Sri Lanka's social and economic stagnation/regression with the consistent growth of Singapore, as we were briefly considered ""the best bet in Asia"" to flourish post-independence, while they possessed significantly lower GDP-per capita in this time period (Lal & Rajapatirana, 1989 in Kelegama, 2000). Many of these same armchair economists attribute this consistent growth to Singapores's exemplary leadership, and blame most of our failures on selfish and shortsighted leaders who divided our allegiances and squandered our resources.

At this point many feel there is nothing we can do or change to get us back to a similar national trajectory to Singapore -- a factor many high-achieving and/or rich students consider when planning to emigrate to countries like UK, USA or Singapore, after graduating their A levels.

However, I feel there is one integral social policy Singapore follows, which we could benefit from emulating: compulsory military service. In Singapore all male citizen over 18 have to engage in National Service, and other countries like Israel require women to engage in these efforts as well. Ever since these policies were implemented, these relatively small nations have flourished due to greater national solidarity, and I feel this solidarity has prevented brain drain and empowered their citizens.

Speaking anecdotally, I have got the opportunity to befriend several Israeli and Singaporean people after they had served their year or two of military service. Those 21-23 year olds were physically and psychologically miles apart from other international students -- the level of competence that resulted as a result of the discipline and confidence they emanated flowed into everything they worked on. Furthermore, unlike most international students who aim to attain PR in their host countries, 2/3 of them have already returned to their home nations.

I feel this can be explained by the social psychology concept of identity fusion, which suggests personal identities and national identities are separate at birth, but gradually 'fuse', when people expend effort on behalf of their nation, or work in solidarity against an external force (Swann Jr. et al., 2012). Again anecdotally, over my 30 years of existence, Sri Lankan culture has been gradually melding with broader Western cultures -- from the Western cartoons we consumed as kids, to the celebration of Western holidays like Halloween now -- and our national identity has become fractured, and we no longer have anything concrete to fuse to. So I personally feel enforcing a policy like this in Sri Lanka, while it definitely has its downsides, like restricting autonomy and building ultra-nationalistic sentiments, could lead to an increase in national solidarity, which could reduce brain drain, while building the physical and psychological capitol of our citizens.

This post/brainfart was just a series of shower thoughts I've been having over the last two weeks, that I wanted to articulate and get some outside opinions on, as I feel other people may have proposed something similar in the past. What do y'all think?

>""We should not teach these **uncivilized things** to our children""

How can this be uncivilized and misdirection? This is what gives them the knowledge on what is right and wrong practices in sex. Actually, this is what protects teenagers from leaning in to bad practices in sex and prevents lot of bad consequences. Not having proper sex education is why teenagers fall into pornography in the first place.

The regular people here are very kind and friendly.
And then you have the Tuktuk driver. 
We like to use Uber and PickMe to move around. But we had allready 2 situations when some Tuktuk Driver got mad as soon as we said that we have a PickMe Driver and they randomly wanted us to cancel that and drive with them - for a higher price of course lol.

One time they blocked the road and ganged up on our Driver, stole his phone and pushed him, glad the police was around although im not really sure they helped the right side because everybody wanted to put the blame on our driver instead. I told them it was not his fault obviously.

Prices are crazy too for a Tuktuk 

For example:
Tuktuk from Midigama to Ahangama: 1200 (2-4km)
Pickme: 385

Uber from Midigama to Galle: 3000 (25km)

How are the prices fair lol ofcourse tourists prefer the Apps!

**I honestly find it hard to believe that Sri Lanka will ever change and here are some reasons**

*-* ***TLDR;*** *The main holder for everything I mentioned is --->* ***Our societal standards are lower than that of the average***\*.\*

1. No road discipline, people honk for literally the smallest thing, not something u see anywhere except here in south asia.
2. Food, etc being really unhygeinic, if you compare it to any country that is not south asia, it's really bad
3. People are reluctant to change, will protest for anything that puts them out of their comfort zone
4. We romanticize what's wrong (we make it normal in society), like **ragging** etc.
5. Absolutely no urban planning, Houses appear literally anywhere, roads aren't even planned, nor are neighourhoods.
6. People fighting over different parties in the parliment that lead to no good (I mean we have quite a few opposition leaders etc, idk much honestly regarding this topic)
7. We are literally known for always being late than scheduled, not doing work properly on time, and just not delivering to a certain expectation (government related services etc, literally the opposite of what some countries are known for).
8. We litter our own surroundings like it's second nature to us, people just don't think twice about throwing their wrappers, bottles etc to the ground after using it, I know this isn't everyone but it's still a fair amount
9. We don't have any advanced industries, when it comes to garbage etc, it's all lacking behind, we can't always keep using the war/government as an excuse.
10.  Spitting the betel leaf thing on the road, it's like just so normal now.

To summarise, I think our people are willing to change and adjust to any law etc in other countries but except our own, you can't always blame the government for everything, like streets that are littered, people not willing to work on time or properly etc.

For me, I thought about the multiple different ways our country could honestly be better, and I don't think it will ever happen without a dictatorship or something, atleast a proper one, democracy will get us nowhere, because you will have to satisfy a bunch on uneducated people or else you lose the vote. Idk this is just my view, even if we have a good government, our cities won't look like that of Japan, Malaysia, Singapore etc, I highly doubt it. The main problems we suffer from live deeply rooted within our socities etc. We are so reluctant to change that the people who want to change will just find themselves moving abroad and never coming back.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oso9zm/i_feel_like_sri_lanka_will_never_honestly_change/,1762707170.0
1osmi3z,"Trivializing Sri Lankan food by calling most savory dishes ""curry"" instead of using individual names",post,"As the title says, people call every dish they eat with a carb as ""curry"". For most people outside south asia, curry is just one specific thing and the whole uniqueness of a dish disappears when you call it as such. For example, I've seen people call ambul thiyal as ""sour fish curry"" or eggplant moju as ""eggplant curry"". There are various cooking styles such as dry toasting (mallung), stir fries (themparadu), dry gravies, or even gravies without the use of any curry powder (such as miris malu or kiri hodi) which all get trivialized into ""curry"". 

I guess people wrongly translate the Sinhala word ""ව්‍යාංජන"" as ""curry"" when a better word would be ""accompaniments"". Now, one could say that there aren't any English names for most Sri Lankan dishes. But, is that really necessary? Nobody uses English names for dishes such as sushi, pad thai, biryani, rendang, pho, and so on.

Need some genuine advice here. I’m planning to upgrade my current vehicle and will have around 6 million LKR once I sell it.

Now, my family’s pushing me to go for something brand new around 10 million, like a Fronx or Perodua Ativa, with a 4 million lease. But honestly, I feel like that’ll just drain me — paying off a heavy lease every month isn’t something I want to stress over.

Personally, I’m more comfortable going for something around 6–7 million, maybe a Swift RS (2017) or similar, so that even if I take a small lease, it’s manageable.

So what do you guys think?

1oshqdu,Ahangama and Tuktuk Mafia,post,"Hello guys 

I am a Tourist from Germany and Ive been in Sri Lanka for 2 weeks now, mostly in the south coast area.
First I want to say: I never thought I would love a country so fast and Ive traveled alot.
The regular people here are very kind and friendly.
And then you have the Tuktuk driver. 
We like to use Uber and PickMe to move around. But we had allready 2 situations when some Tuktuk Driver got mad as soon as we said that we have a PickMe Driver and they randomly wanted us to cancel that and drive with them - for a higher price of course lol.

One time they blocked the road and ganged up on our Driver, stole his phone and pushed him, glad the police was around although im not really sure they helped the right side because everybody wanted to put the blame on our driver instead. I told them it was not his fault obviously.

Prices are crazy too for a Tuktuk 

For example:
Tuktuk from Midigama to Ahangama: 1200 (2-4km)
Pickme: 385

Uber from Midigama to Galle: 3000 (25km)

How are the prices fair lol ofcourse tourists prefer the Apps!

Kind regards

1ossevq,Should I go for a brand-new car with a big lease or stay within my comfort zone?,post,"Hey everyone,

Need some genuine advice here. I’m planning to upgrade my current vehicle and will have around 6 million LKR once I sell it.

Now, my family’s pushing me to go for something brand new around 10 million, like a Fronx or Perodua Ativa, with a 4 million lease. But honestly, I feel like that’ll just drain me — paying off a heavy lease every month isn’t something I want to stress over.

Personally, I’m more comfortable going for something around 6–7 million, maybe a Swift RS (2017) or similar, so that even if I take a small lease, it’s manageable.

So what do you guys think?
Is it worth stretching for a brand-new car and a big lease, or better to stay practical and avoid the financial pressure?

1oso9zm,"I feel like Sri Lanka will never honestly change or develop, am I correct on this view?",post,"Genuine question, I know that we have a decent government (All I heard is that they are good and genuine, I'm not very political), but will this actually lead to any real improvement?

**I honestly find it hard to believe that Sri Lanka will ever change and here are some reasons**

*-* ***TLDR;*** *The main holder for everything I mentioned is --->* ***Our societal standards are lower than that of the average***\*.\*

1. No road discipline, people honk for literally the smallest thing, not something u see anywhere except here in south asia.
2. Food, etc being really unhygeinic, if you compare it to any country that is not south asia, it's really bad
3. People are reluctant to change, will protest for anything that puts them out of their comfort zone
4. We romanticize what's wrong (we make it normal in society), like **ragging** etc.
5. Absolutely no urban planning, Houses appear literally anywhere, roads aren't even planned, nor are neighourhoods.
6. People fighting over different parties in the parliment that lead to no good (I mean we have quite a few opposition leaders etc, idk much honestly regarding this topic)
7. We are literally known for always being late than scheduled, not doing work properly on time, and just not delivering to a certain expectation (government related services etc, literally the opposite of what some countries are known for).
8. We litter our own surroundings like it's second nature to us, people just don't think twice about throwing their wrappers, bottles etc to the ground after using it, I know this isn't everyone but it's still a fair amount
9. We don't have any advanced industries, when it comes to garbage etc, it's all lacking behind, we can't always keep using the war/government as an excuse.
10.  Spitting the betel leaf thing on the road, it's like just so normal now.

To summarise, I think our people are willing to change and adjust to any law etc in other countries but except our own, you can't always blame the government for everything, like streets that are littered, people not willing to work on time or properly etc.

For me, I thought about the multiple different ways our country could honestly be better, and I don't think it will ever happen without a dictatorship or something, atleast a proper one, democracy will get us nowhere, because you will have to satisfy a bunch on uneducated people or else you lose the vote. Idk this is just my view, even if we have a good government, our cities won't look like that of Japan, Malaysia, Singapore etc, I highly doubt it. The main problems we suffer from live deeply rooted within our socities etc. We are so reluctant to change that the people who want to change will just find themselves moving abroad and never coming back.",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1oso9zm/i_feel_like_sri_lanka_will_never_honestly_change/,1762707170.0

1osmi3z,"Trivializing Sri Lankan food by calling most savory dishes ""curry"" instead of using individual names",post,"As the title says, people call every dish they eat with a carb as ""curry"". For most people outside south asia, curry is just one specific thing and the whole uniqueness of a dish disappears when you call it as such. For example, I've seen people call ambul thiyal as ""sour fish curry"" or eggplant moju as ""eggplant curry"". There are various cooking styles such as dry toasting (mallung), stir fries (themparadu), dry gravies, or even gravies without the use of any curry powder (such as miris malu or kiri hodi) which all get trivialized into ""curry"". 

I guess people wrongly translate the Sinhala word ""ව්‍යාංජන"" as ""curry"" when a better word would be ""accompaniments"". Now, one could say that there aren't any English names for most Sri Lankan dishes. But, is that really necessary? Nobody uses English names for dishes such as sushi, pad thai, biryani, rendang, pho, and so on. Even when there are ""English"" words, they don't mean much to someone outside Sri Lanka (hoppers or string hoppers are great examples). So, why not use the proper sinhala/tamil names?",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1osmi3z/trivializing_sri_lankan_food_by_calling_most/,1762702972.0

>""We should not teach these **uncivilized things** to our children""

>""This is not education. This is misdirection""

How can this be uncivilized and misdirection? This is what gives them the knowledge on what is right and wrong practices in sex. Actually, this is what protects teenagers from leaning in to bad practices in sex and prevents lot of bad consequences. Not having proper sex education is why teenagers fall into pornography in the first place.

Man I am so angry right now. I thought having a good government would lead a country to a better future but now that I realize that would never happen with this backward thinking people of our country, even if we get a good government like our current one.
