1omg7pp,Minimal Life Survival Challenge in Colombo,post,"Hey everyone,

I'm planning to spend some time in Colombo after Nov 26
on a very tight budget and want to test a minimalist
lifestyle living and working in the city while keeping
expenses as close to zero as possible.

I've done something similar before in Trinco and Kandy,
so this time | want to see how it works in a busy city like
Colombo.

Here's my basic plan:
+ Work on my laptop during the day from cafes, libraries

or public spaces (doing freelance projects)

- Eat cheap but healthy meals rice packets, fruits, boiled
eggs, oats, etc.

- Use public wells or temple areas for bathing and
washing clothes

- Stay somewhere safe at night (mainly public spaces
that are open and not risky)

- Use free public water as much as possible
This is just a personal discipline experiment, not a

travel post or financial problem I’m curious about urban
survival and minimal living.

Would love local suggestions on:

- Safe areas to stay through the night

- Cafes or public spots good for laptop work
- Cheap healthy food options

- Free water or washing spots

- Any safety or practical advice

Any insights from locals would really use full

1fms0jd,Thank you Ranil! Thank you for everything you did to our country!!!,post,"THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT!!!

Thank you, Ranil, for half a century of political mastery! Your
six terms as PM proved that progress is just a state of mind.
From your early days ""solving"" the Batalanda issue (RIP
65,000 youths) to your visionary peace deals with LTTE (who
doesn't love a well-armed insurgency?), you've always kept us
on our toes.

Your economic genius shines bright - robbing the Central Bank
of SL, selling national assets, and accumulating loans. Thanks
to you, every citizen now feels the weight of national debt!
Your talent for increasing crime rates while protecting your
Rajapaksha friends is truly unmatched. Who needs rule of law
when you have loyalty?

Let's not forget your 2015 masterpiece: acquiring a ""sacrificial
goat"" for president while you pulled the strings. Your power
struggle with said goat was riveting political theater! And
when terror struck our churches, your government's inaction
was... something else.

Even in ""retirement,"" you couldn't resist coming back to fix the
economic crisis you totally didn't cause. Ranil, you've left an
indelible mark on our nation. Future generations will struggle

to forget you, no matter how hard they try. Bravo!

A terrible journey from Peradeniya to Colombo.

Today at about 4 pm | was at a bus stop in Peradeniya to heading towards
Colombo. | was told | can certainly get a seat in the bus, so | was hoping to travel
back a comfortable journey.

Colombo bus reached the bus stop, but all seats were filled, and a few passengers
were standing inside the bus too. | asked the conductor, and he said many seats
will be available from Mawanella, as many passengers will get down at the
Mawanella bus stop. | trusted that conductor and got into the bus. The bus was
reaching Mawanella, but not a single passenger got down from that bus. | thought |
was fooled by the conductor. | was travelling almost 4 hours by standing, and | was
having the feeling to sleep but struggling mentally and physically. | was reaching
Nittambuwa, and | thought to get down from the bus and sit on the pavement, as |
can't carry on this journey anymore. Sometimes | was thinking of sitting on the
floorboard of the bus. To be honest, my legs were shivering and my head was
spinning. | was holding my pain and decided to go further in my terrible journey.
Whenever | was seeing that conductor on the bus, | really wanted to punch him in
the face.

Somehow | reached Urugodawatta Junction, and | got down from the bus. | was
not fit to walk, but | slowly walked and got a tuk-tuk. | reached out to a well-
wisher's place in Mahawatha, as he is a tea taster with 45 years of experience. |
had a nice tea before heading back to my place.

What 16 personality type is Ranil
Wickremesinghe?

Ranil Wickremesinghe could be classified as an
ENTJ personality type. This type is characterized by
being driven, strategic, assertive, and decisive.
Wickremesinghe's strong |eadership skills and
ability to make tough decisions are key indicators
of this personality type.

As an ENTJ, Wickremesinghe is likely to possess
strong organizational skills and a clear vision for
the future. He is likely to be goal-oriented and
efficient in his approach to leading a country. His
assertiveness and confidence in his decision-
making may also be evident in his political
interactions.

the country in 1971. Later that year, she was handed
over to the army where she was tortured, raped and
paraded naked through the streets, !""! and then burnt
alive before finally being murdered by a gunshot to

g2k72a,Racist Policies Mar Covid-19 Mitigation,post,"Whilst medical and other professionals are fighting an exemplary and highly praiseworthy battle to mitigate the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, highhanded and openly undemocratic policies including rabidly racist and chauvinist approaches by the Rajapaksa regime are marring effective containment of the pandemic, an umbrella body of independent professionals has revealed.

According to the third press release issued by a little-known ‘Independent Professionals Alliance’ last Tuesday (14) on Sri Lanka’s Response to Covid-19 has made a startling revelation that in stark contrast to medical best practices and ethics practiced in most countries, the Rajapaksa regime conducted racial profiling of patients in order to portray a correlation between Covid-19 and the Muslim community.

“… reference to “population categories” is alarming as the government initiated an ethnicity survey of those infected and taken into quarantine in a bid to demonstrate that Covid-19 was mainly prevalent among the Muslim community.”

The statement further claims that “the results were not released when the data did not match the claim. The study found that only 6.3% of the first 191 patients were Muslim, despite Muslims being 37% of those taken into forcible quarantine…”

The release also has hinted on a close nexus between the anti-Muslim and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) administration.

“Main Covid-19 clusters are ethnically classified by the government. Some of the doctors who are closely associated with the SLPP are openly critical of Muslims. For example, Director of the National Cancer Hospital Dr. Wasantha Dissanayaka has called one Muslim Covid-19 patient a “walking bomb.”

This comes high in the heels of many complaints from all over Sri Lanka by Muslims that they were subject to harassment and degrading treatment by authorities such as Police officers, Public Health Inspectors (PHIs), Grama Niladaris (GNs) and other public officials openly stating that “they cannot trust Muslims…” and “…Muslims are the root cause for the spread of the corona virus,” and “Kalutara, Maradana and Beruwala are examples of ‘Muslims’ spreading the virus” etc…

Further distressing factor is that several of these individuals directly spearheading such chauvinistic and racist policies are Muslims themselves including Rajapaksa lackey and State Intelligence Service (SIS) Chief Brigadier Suresh Sallay who was Director of Military Intelligence in the pre-2015 Rajapakse government, and was promoted four ranks from Captain to Brigadier in under five years; is leaking information of “Muslim” patients to media and politicians in the government.

On the Sinhala and Tamil New Years day, the government gazetted regulations forcing the immediate cremation of Covid-19 fatalities and those who are “suspected to have died” of Covid-19 which is openly seen as a ‘major assault’ on the Muslim community.

The statement also lamented that almost “all electronic media institutions except the MTV/Sirasa network are engaged in propaganda to promote the President, military and ideology of nationalism” since the public have become a captive audience of the media channels due to the curfew.

We publish below the press release in full:

STATUS STATEMENT III: 14 April 2020

Sri Lanka’s Response to Covid-19

1. Health Response

Testing has become the main challenge for Sri Lanka. The government has consciously erected several roadblocks to minimise testing and obfuscate the spread of Covid-19 in Sri Lanka. Despite significant domestic testing capacity, a quota of no more than 212 patients a day are being tested for Covid-19, as at 11th April 2019. With the available laboratory facilities, technicians and supply chain capacity, up to 1,200 patients can be tested per day. Mass testing is widely considered an essential prerequisite to safely opening up countries under lockdown.

For example, even most medical workers who are suspected to have come into contact with Covid-19 infected patients cannot be tested under the Health Ministry’s guidelines for managing such suspected cases. Even persons taken forcibly into quarantine are only eligible for testing if they were taken “from selected high risk geographical and / or population categories”, according to Health Ministry directives. The reference to “population categories” is alarming as the government initiated an ethnicity survey of those infected and taken into quarantine in a bid to demonstrate that Covid-19 was mainly prevalent among the Muslim community. However, the results were not released when the data did not match the claim. The study found that only 6.3% of the first 191 patients were Muslim, despite Muslims being 37% of those taken into forcible quarantine and denied testing.

The government has gazetted regulations that force the immediate cremation of Covid-19 fatalities and those who are “suspected to have died” of Covid-19 without conducting any tests or post-mortem examinations. This measure is both a further assault on the Muslim community and an attempt to artificially minimise the number of “confirmed cases” of Covid-19 in Sri Lanka to maintain public support for the government.

Consequent to pressure from medical specialists, the government has decided to increase the daily quota of Covid-19 tests although the criteria to qualify for testing remains so stringent as to artificially minimise the number of known cases. Sri Lanka is carrying out fewer tests per capita than almost any other democracy with an active outbreak. The team advising the President fears large scale testing would show many thousands of cases and negatively impact his party’s prospect of holding parliamentary elections and securing a strong majority. These factors have also influenced the government’s decision to prevent antibody testing in Sri Lanka in its clinical guidelines (page 11), which would show how many people have been infected and recovered from the virus undetected by the state.

There have been several dozen deaths in Sri Lanka due to pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms in the last several weeks but no tests are done on them. There were at least 18 deaths across the country with undiagnosed respiratory deceases but Government does not attribute it to COVID-19. No post-mortems were permitted. The corpses were cremated with the same precautions afforded to Covid-19 fatalities. In all those cases, health officials and military officers were ordered to cremate the bodies at the earliest opportunity with minimum publicity. Patients in such condition can only be tested for Covid-19 under extraordinary circumstances, such as if they have had known contact with other Covid-19 patients, or if there is no other possible explanation for their symptoms, according to the Health Ministry’s case definition criteria.

The Prime Minister, in his address to the nation on 7th April stated that there are 40 Quarantine centres but health authorities are not aware of more than 18 centres. AIP sources confirm the existence of 28 quarantine centres, most of which are located within Military Camps, including two luxury centres in Diyathalawa for VIPs, those returning from abroad and foreign citizens.

Medical facilities in Sri Lanka are operated by experienced well trained staff, supported by a network of well-established rural medical networks. For examples, Public Health Inspectors have long been in place to cover all areas in the country. Sri Lankan doctors are considered among the best in clinical medicine. They rely on science in advising and treating patients and often challenge unempirical myths. However, some of the key figures in the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), due to their long political association of the Rajapakse family and nationalist Buddhist Monks started to promote traditional medicines in the government health systems. The leading figure of GMOA, Dr. Anurudda Padeniya (Paediatric neurologist) with no specific medical scientific research) recently came out publicly that Buddhist teachings are the answer to pandemic. In another interview, Dr Padeniya claimed that he heads a research team for the Health Ministry and called for the use of herbal smoke/vapour (දුම් ඇල්ලීම) in households to boost immunity. He said the fumes or vapour from a pot filled with boiled water and unnamed herbs may be spread around a person (taking care to keep their eyes closed) for this purpose.

Dr. Padeniya said a committee headed by him has unanimously endorsed this practice in the fight against COVID-19. Instead of well tested medical research, he relies on an unknown study allegedly conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology without peer review, which leads to uninformed public believing that kohthamalli (coriander) and venivelgeta (Coscinium fenestratum or tree turmeric) are the answer to COVID-19. These assertions have strengthened mythical beliefs in Sri Lanka. Established Ayurvedha medical specialists have come forward to deny the claims of GMOA and stated that smoke is not a treatment recognised in any credible medical system in the world.

Several highly qualified specialist doctors and medical academics have challenged the GMOA and alleged that the President has been mislead by the GMOA, which has a conflict of interest as a trade union and not a policy making organisation. However, during the last week, many medical professionals have released more valuable statements, demonstrating that the President has thus far bypassed the real medical experts in the country in taking crucial decisions. The GMOA cannot be an independent voice due to its close political association with the Rajapakse government and its nationalist political ideology.

The military and intelligence services remain in charge of the government’s effort against Covid-19. State Intelligence Service Chief Brigadier Suresh Sallay was Director of Military Intelligence in the pre-2015 Rajapakse government, and is considered a loyalist of the President, who promoted him four ranks from Captain to Brigadier in under five years. However, the health authorities have expressed their disappointment in the intelligence services leaking information of the patients to media and politicians in the government. For example, the identity of a recent patient, gem businessman married to a Foreign Ministry employee, was flashed in the newspapers with a narrative suggesting that the patient was a traitor to the nation. This raises the issue of Sri Lanka not respecting the privacy of patients.

2. Media Landscape

The media plays a subservient role at present, restricting their journalism to the verbatim reproduction of government messages and communiques, avoiding any investigative journalism for fear of the military and intelligence services. All electronic media institutions except the MTV/Sirasa network are engaged in propaganda to promote the President, military and ideology of nationalism. Due to the curfew, the public have become a captive audience of the media channels, which promote the military and government in its messaging. All programmes without exception are designed to give only the narrative of the government. There is a coordinated approach in not permitting any type of a counter narrative to the government’s perspective, and blindly parroting the commitment of the military to save the country and commitment of the people to be ready to contribute to the motherland in future by making sacrifices on behalf of the government and military.

The key messages during the last two weeks in media can be categorised as follows:

– The President has saved the country from Covid-19 and he is the only leader who can save the country from economic downfall

– Parliament would be an impediment in combating the pandemic

– It is preferable for the President to run the country without a Parliament

– People must support the President and Military at any cost

– Minorities are unhygienic and are not helping the President to counter Covid-19

– Europe and USA are failures to be mocked and derided but China has set an example to be admired

The media has given overwhelming coverage to pro-Rajapakse voices to echo the demand for an authoritarian government that can discipline the people and fight Covid-19. Among the messages is to promote the idea of having a country without a legislature, where the President can rule by diktat.

On 4th April, the Anunayake (deputy) of the Asgiriya Chapter, Vendaruwe Upali Thero, a nationalist monk closely associated with the military and Rajapakse family, stressed that parliamentary elections must be postponed for three years. This monk made waves when he attended a birthday felicitation at Gotabaya Rajapakse’s home in June 2018 and called on him to become Sri Lanka’s “Hitler”. He said the public is seeking help to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic and spending over Rs. 7 billion for the purpose would be a waste of money. This crisis does not depend on politicians’ advice, for the public does not demand a Parliament but medical advice, the Thero added. The media has selectively curated “voice cuts” of politicians loyal to the President to support this view.

The Chinese Embassy’s strong objection in relation to an article published in Daily Mirror, accusing China of Covid-19 Negligence is significant. The letter of the Spokesperson and Chief of Political Section of the Embassy underlines the attitude of China towards the Sri Lankan media. China had awarded free exposure tours to their country to over 120 Sri Lankan journalists and hundreds of officers of strategic public institutions such as universities, the police, Attorney General’s Department, judiciary, and institutions involved in the logistic sector and Sri Lanka Administrative Service officers. The Chinese government keeps regular contact with trusted individuals in those institutions. In that backdrop, China feels let down by the Daily Mirror article. China remains in the media spotlight due to yesterday’s suspension of the Twitter account of the Chinese embassy in Colombo.

3. Ethnic Discrimination in counter-COVID-19 measures

Reports in various parts of the country signal visible discrimination and harassment targeted at ethnic minorities, particularly in the areas where they are concentrated:

There is no clear established system to ensure granting of movement passes within outside and inside districts. People in Jaffna are required to obtain passes from the Military while people in other parts of the country are required to obtain the same from police, who use their discretion in granting passes. Tamils and Muslims are routinely denied curfew passes. In Jaffna and Mulaitivu, the people are largely frightened of the military.

On 7th April, in Gurunagar and a few other areas in Jaffna, people pleaded with the authorities for food but the military had beaten the people in front of their houses. Thereafter, Divisional Secretaries requested that a few NGOs supply food. Military officers in civilian clothing interrogated and chased away NGO representatives who attempted to deliver food.

On 5th April, during curfew, a family of five Muslims in Beruwala were removed by the Military without informing any local civilian authorities or health authorities. Their current whereabouts were unknown for at least 4 days. Two similar incidents have been reported in the Akurana, Kandy District.

All quarantine centres are managed by the Military. Frequently, when Tamil or Muslim individuals are released from the centre a camera crew attached to an electronic media organisation loyal to the president is alerted, and they forcibly record a “voice cut” thanking the President and Military. Some gave voice cuts voluntarily but when Tamils and Muslims have declined to make such statements, they are forced to make statements, as coached by the staff, so these materials can be used by the President’s election campaign propaganda units in the future.

Main Covid-19 clusters are ethnically classified by the government. Some of the doctors who are closely associated with the SLPP are openly critical of Muslims. For example, Director of the National Cancer Hospital Dr. Wasantha Dissanayaka has called one Muslim Covid-19 patient a “walking bomb.”

Public opinion is being swayed to believe that the Muslims are spreading the virus, which has created anti-Muslim sentiment. Hiru and Derana (two TV Channels owned by President’s close associates) are openly promoting racial hatred in their news bulletins and political discussions but no action has been taken against any one of them, or others claiming on social media that Muslims are deliberately spreading the virus. Meanwhile, Ramzie Raziq, a well-known social media activist, was arrested and jailed for posting a clip objecting to the unfair assertions made against Muslims.

4. Conduct of Foreign Ministry and treatment of Sri Lankans held up abroad

More than half of the Embassies in Europe and key Embassies in other regions are vacant and managed by inexperienced Sri Lanka Foreign Service officers, who are known for laziness, a lack of motivation and obsession with bureaucracy. Covid-19 has demonstrated the ineptitude and disorientation of the Foreign Ministry. The Secretary has not been permitted to any initiative to protect Sri Lankan staff in foreign missions even in terms of medical care. Most of the missions have been hostile to Sri Lankans seeking advice and guidance. The government has failed to take any initiative to protect citizens seeking to return to Sri Lanka. It is significant that the Foreign Ministry is not represented in any High Profile Task Forces on COVID 19.

Sixty individuals, primarily former and serving military officers, and relations or close associates of the President have been shortlisted for posts diplomatic missions. A few of those positions in Sydney, Japan, Russia, UAE, Thailand, Italy and Malaysia are earmarked for serving military intelligence officers, who were arrested or indicted with abductions and killings of journalists during the previous Rajapakse Government. The government is preparing the appointment of two serving senior military officers into newly created Deputy Head of Mission posts for the Sri Lankan missions in Geneva and New York. New appointments are expected to be made with effect from 31st May.

Over 140 students are held up in Malaysia/Singapore (transit from Australia and New Zealand) and Dubai (transit from UK) and a few other Airports for over two weeks but they are not permitted to enter Sri Lanka as the government had closed the borders. Desperate students and their families have repeatedly made futile requests to the foreign ministry, President, Prime Minister and businessmen close to the President. Many Sri Lankan students are held up in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. However, moves are afoot to bring back about 35 young adults and children associated with powerful individuals in the government before the 15th April.

5. Application of the law on Social Distancing

Hiru (one of the two leading private electronic media channels, closely connected to the President and promoting racial feelings, has conducted a major recording of a New Year festival at Thalawathugoda, Colombo District with the participation of 130 outside participants and over 50 connected staff member and security personnel. Police confirms that no curfew passes were issued for this event nor was there any clearance obtained from the authorities, except that the President’s Office had given verbal approval. The station owner’s brother, Duminda Silva, is on death row for murdering several people. He is expecting a presidential pardon prior to parliamentary elections.

There were a series of meetings conducted by the Ministers in the guise of handing over medical equipment to medical facilities. All these meetings were attended by over 100 outsiders and media without following social distancing rules. For example, Minister Wimal Weerawansa handed over an air conditioner to Homagama Hospital on 6th April. Meanwhile, UNP parliamentarian Ranjan Ramanayake was arrested (for the third time in three months) by the government for conducting similar activities near his residence.

During the last two weeks, the Minister of Health Pavithra Wanniarachchi has conducted a series of meetings in medical facilities, with the participation of health officials and local politicians and candidates of the SLPA. Meetings took place during the curfew and did not follow social distancing.

Distribution of Samurdhi (social welfare payment of Rs.5,000) to the recipients are taking place throughout the country with the participation of Grama Niladharai officers and the SLPP organisational structure. Distribution of money is taking place in groups, without heed to social distancing guidelines. Those who have not received the payments (mostly the Estate Tamils and families of known opposition supporters) have held several protests, ignoring social distancing requirements.

7. President vs. Election Commission

By the time the President decided to dissolve Parliament on 2nd March, local health authorities had been warning for over one month that Sri Lanka needed to brace itself to combat Covid-19, and after the WHO declared Covid-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The President dismissed the warnings of his own health officials, eager to face a parliamentary election with opposition parties deeply fractured. The decision by the Elections Commission to exercise its powers angered the government. The President spurned a request from the Commission that the Supreme Court be consulted to determine a constitutionally appropriate solution to the impasse. Instead, the President demanded that the Commission holds Parliamentary elections as ordered by the President irrespective of the health situation in the country.

This impasse is one of the key reasons that the government is drastically limiting Covid-19 virus and antibody testing in Sri Lanka, in order to first declare the disease eradicated in Sri Lanka, and to then hold elections to secure a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which would allow the President to radically amend the Constitution and strengthen his powers. However, the Elections Commission cannot be forced to hold elections, and one of its three members responded to the President emphasising that it would be impractical for the Commission to hold elections and calling on the President to rescind his decision to dissolve Parliament.

Meanwhile, the government is using the state and private media to generate public support for holding a snap general election within the next eight weeks, timed to coincide with a public announcement that they have become the first country to eradicate Covid-19.The Army Commander has declared on the President’s behalf that the eradication will be complete by 24th April, and universities and schools have been ordered to reopen their campuses and classrooms by 15th May in order to exert additional pressure on the Elections Commission to hold an election as soon as possible.

g5vdam,How Sri Lanka fights back COVID-19 better than any others | Why Sri Lanka,post,"Isn’t Sri Lanka still a developing country? Does Sri Lanka have the required health privileges and technology to fight back Covid-19?

You might have a thousand questions on why Sri Lanka has suddenly become important amid this pandemic. But let me reassure you that Sri Lanka was always relevant, however everybody has expected the dominating countries were the solution for everything.

So, how exactly is Sri Lanka building the resistance? Here’s the proof.

How it all started in Sri Lanka?

Sole COVID-19 patient in Sri Lanka discharged from hospital after recovery

Covid-19 or the novel coronavirus started taking people’s lives one by one in the beginning of 2020. Although the pandemic originated in China, now the death toll worldwide has risen into 308,645 (May 16, 2020).

The Quarantine Unit at Bandaranaike International Airport was instructed to be aware and properly check the virus carriers by the Ministry of Health Sri Lanka.

This was started even before 27th of January.

Sri Lankan Health Ministry instructed people especially including pregnant women, infants, kids, people with chronic diseases and elder people to practice social distancing.

Also, the government restricted the Chinese employees to their workplaces to avoid the spread of the virus.

Although the whole world was panicking, it all started in Sri Lanka when the authorities found a 43-year-old Chinese tourist. She was infected with the virus and known to have travelled all around the island.

Sri Lanka vs Public health

Sri Lanka was identified as one of the most vulnerable countries against Covid-19. There is some truth to that.

In fact, On 16th of April 2020, Sri Lanka has entered the list of countries which are at high risk in front of the virus pandemic. SL ranked 16th place.

Sri Lanka is not at the top for its sanitation. On top of that, the health sector doesn’t have a lot of facilities because the country is still in its developing stage.

The next main reason for this high risk is, Sri Lanka’s public transportation system is not like other developed countries.

Unlike rich countries such as Singapore, Sri Lanka has very poor conditioned public transportation and hygiene related to it.

The other unfortunate problem is, people are not generally well mannered.

For example, public transportation systems are destroyed by misuse. Most of the places are covered in red spit that came from chewing Betel leaf with Areca nuts.

For some Sri Lankans sanitizers and paper serviettes came to limelight just after the coronavirus pandemic.

This is not just a Sri Lankan issue, but why on earth the authorities and the health ministries have to constantly remind you to cover your nose and mouth whenever you cough or sneeze?

People don’t even know that?

Yet, humans are known to be the most intelligent among all the other species on the earth.

Do we need a reality check?

Sri Lanka’s situation compared to other countries

The USA

According to popular belief the United States is the most dominant country in the whole wide world in every aspect.

But, looking at their Covid-19 death toll, which is (88,199) it is a big IF now!

In April 2020 an anti-lockdown movement was started by the Americans protesting the lockdown.

Many people in places such as Florida and California have come out of their residencies to protest.

According to Nine News Australia, these thousands of protesters didn’t even have masks on. Most of them are begging to go to work. Some women say that they need to go to the hairdressers.

People claim that Covid-19 is a total lie, and they need to be liberated as they are not prisoners.

The most ridiculous news is that Michigan has the 4th highest Covid-19 cases in the country. United States President Donald Trump supports these protests and in fact has shared his thoughts on liberating Michigan. He further says that the people are reasonable.

Although Covid-19 can be carried through the bodies of humans unknowingly infecting others in the process, the people or the authorities don’t seem to care.

The UK

The United Kingdom’s total deaths are now at 33,998. (May 16, 2020)

People have reported on many occasions that authorities don’t care about the infected. The only advice they have given is to be self-quarantined and take care of themselves.

But it is clear the government is doing their best to prevent the pandemic.

NHS (National Health Service) in England has decided to pause the investigations of all new and existing Covid-19 complaints.

According to them, this decision further helps the clinical staff to give proper care for the people who are already admitted. Their decision is great for some extent because these people who are in critical situations need to be properly looked after. However, it seems like the other people are expendable.

Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka on the other hand, doesn’t even have the resources or money to protect people. However, after the first chinese patient was found, she was admitted to IDH. (Infectious Diseases Hospital)

The chinese patient was fully recovered with the sole support of the free healthcare system and an expert crew of doctors and nurses etc. and returned to her homeland on February 19th, 2020.

The government took immediate measures to self-confine people around the country by imposing an island wide curfew.

Both the government and the private sector employees were instructed to stay at home and continue their work.

The only drawback of this is, unlike the United Kingdom people cannot be paid 80% of their remuneration in SL if the pandemic stays for longer.

The recent situation is Sri Lanka is actually very good and the overall death toll in the country is still at 7 so far.

Furthermore, Sri Lanka has been named as the 9th best country which successfully executed an immediate and effective response on preventing the virus.

Why is Sri Lanka better?

Sri Lanka is a Tropical Country

The Covid-19 outbreak horrified the whole world first emerging in China. The incident happened in the middle of December 2019. Without a doubt, it spread so fast around the world.

This speculated the thought of the cooler weather can be a support to the virus to be sustained.

Paul Charles, the Chief Executive of PC Agency who is one of the travel experts in the UK stated that he would be going somewhere with warmer weather. He further had suggested that Sri Lanka is a safe destination for everybody who seeks a safe getaway from the pandemic.

Although there is no evidence to prove that Covid-19 cannot stay that much longer in warmer weather, it is an intriguing theory.

Maybe, this is another reason why Sri Lanka has managed to maintain its death toll at a low rate.

Sri Lanka is an Island

I’m surprised that you haven’t heard that Sri Lanka is an island nation. (Haha)

Well, all jokes aside, an Island can be the best place on earth to hide from a pandemic.

Think about it, after the government had completely stopped the arrivals and departures in the airports, there is no way a mishap can occur.

Simply because there is no way to enter. The only way the virus got into the country was via the people who previously arrived from other countries.

The exceptional instance to prove this is Greenland. It is the world’s largest island nation.

The other finest example is Madagascar. It is the 2nd largest island in the world.

They both have a Covid-19 death rate still at 0.

Sri Lanka’s generous star hotels

If you have ever visited Sri Lanka, you couldn’t have missed a free meal or a drink somewhere by the side of the road.

This is even better in the months of buddhist religious importance. It is no secret that Sri Lanka oozes generosity and hospitality.

According to the WGI or the World Giving Index, Sri Lanka made it to the 5th place in the list of most charitable countries in the world.

Hirimbura Chandra Lal Abeygunawardena who is a businessman from Galle has offered his 30-room hotel in Unawatuna and another hotel in Thalgampola for Covid-19 patients.

Five-star Citrus Waskaduwa by Citrus Leisure PLC has offered the premises to be used by the

National Operations Center as a quarantine center.

Four-star Trinco Blu by Cinnamon owned by Conglomerate John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) was offered to be used as a quarantine center as well if there is a larger need. They also stated that they are willing to offer the other Cinnamon properties in the country if the need arises.

Moreover, Four-star Club Hotel Dolphin which is located in Negombo owned by Hemas Holdings PLC offered their large premises. It is only 20 km away from the Bandaranaike International Airport which is a plus point.

Fundraising

The funds for the Covid-19 Healthcare and Social Security is now over Rs. 242 million. Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa initiated the fund on March 23rd.

People’s Bank Pensioners Association, People’s Leasing, Litro Gas Lanka Limited, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and Bank of Ceylon, The National Savings Bank and Akbar Brothers Pvt Ltd have contributed so far to reach this amount.

Other people are also allowed to donate for this fund as well.

Public Health care system

Most of the time, locals have been complaining about numerous incidents in the past years when the Sri Lankan health care system neglects essential needs of the people. However, Covid-19 has proven that Sri Lankan hospitals, doctors and other employees are working their socks off to prevent the current situation.

The most fascinating thing is, from rich to poor there is no discrimination for treating Covid-19 patients.

The employees put the country on top without even caring for their own families.

From the overall 310 confirmed cases, 102 patients are fully recovered so far.

Sri Lanka is tiny

Sri Lanka is a tiny island. Anyone can reach from one side to another side of the country under a day by a standard car.

By (2012) Sri Lanka’s population is at 20,277,597.

This can be considered as a lucky break for Sri Lanka, since it is easier to manage people especially in a critical situation like this.

Sri Lankan army is very supportive

The Sri Lankan army has a great reputation for helping people and putting their lives on the line for them despite their nationality.

It is obvious that they serve day and night to prevent the virus from spreading further in the country.

The quarantine zones are mainly taken care of by the military. Even people who have been in and recovered at those quarantine centers have said in social media that they never even had homesickness. Their hospitality is that much exceptional.

The army has provided the patients with special toiletries, sanitary items, outfits, meals and Wi-Fi free of charge during the period of treatments.

The police and the government are responsible

Sri Lanka might be the only country where people are chased down and dragged into medical care.

We have previously witnessed that many other countries don’t even care about the patients who are stuck inside their homes.

However, Sri Lankan police always try to prevent the pandemic spread further by finding infected people around the country with much effort.

The government on the other hand didn’t even have time to prove its full potential. Because, if memory serves, Sri Lanka hadn’t even been recovered from the last year Easter attacks.

But the government suddenly had to react to the new threat befell upon the country.

No government is unblemished, but this government did respond to the critical situation better than everybody has anticipated.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that Sri Lanka is handling the Covid-19 situation very well. However, Sri Lanka isn’t a country which can perform miracles.

If the public doesn’t take the required measures to prevent the virus from spreading, Sri Lanka won’t be any different than the USA in a couple of months.

The main obstruction is the awareness of the public. Most of the people understand that Covid-19 is a fatal virus.

But, still the minority don’t believe in social distancing.

The minute the government instructs to lift the imposed curfew, people start to wander around the city buying supplies.

The groceries, toiletries and other household items with vegetables and fruits are delivered to the customers’ doorsteps.

But it is mostly available in the Colombo area. It is understandable that some people don’t have this opportunity, but they should think about their own families and children before going out.

The bottom line is, even if the situation is being controlled successfully in the country, it is crucial for each and every citizen to be responsible to overcome this pandemic.",0,https://whysrilanka.com/2020/04/21/how-sri-lanka-fights-back-covid-19-better-than-any-others/,1587533316.0

The reason why Arab traders were welcomed by
Sinhalese kings and intermarried with local woman is
because they were trustworthy and honest dealers.

Portuguese and any other Europeans were a threat to
the Sinhalese society and moors were the
trustworthy. Even Tamils were a threat back then. But
moors were not a threat due to humbleness and
honesty they had. They did business nicely and
without cheating. This is why moors were welcomed
by local kings and even intermarried them.

Also there was a situation where a moor lady had
distracted a European invader when asking directions
for king's place, and that was a heroic deed and the
term “maa-raeka-lé” was formed which tranlates to
“blood who saved me” by the king who was saved.

Now you know how important the moors are.
And you can update your history lesson.

And Jews are known to be tricksters and liars. No
wonder they have big nose. Also they are known as
“stealers” especially financially. These people are
never humble. Now you know. | mean just imagine
them being a harassment to all of us when it comes
to hurting local woman, invading properties, doing
unfair business practices and even any other
pollution imaginable.

187ko4v,"Buddha used to be Vishnu in India. In Sri Lanka, Vishnu is a future Buddha",post,"But this Sri Lankan Vishnu was not the supreme Hindu deity familiar to us. Rather, just as 19 th -century Indian Hindus saw the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, their Sri Lankan Buddhist counterparts had their own version of Vishnu, subordinate to the Buddha (as many Sri Lankans do even today). The evolution of this deity challenges many notions of South Asian religious nationalism. Borders and hierarchies among the gods were never as fixed as we might imagine.

In 1848, less than a decade before North India’s 1857 uprising , a Sri Lankan chieftain, Gongalegoda Banda, prepared to rise up against the British. To do so he asked for the blessings of the island’s protector deity: not the Buddha, but Vishnu.

‘Hindu’ and ‘Buddhist’ in Sri Lankan kingship

Especially in the aftermath of the Sri Lankan Civil War, nationalists in Sri Lanka have tended to project “Sinhalas” as eternally Buddhist, aloof from mainland Indian trends. Nothing could be further from the truth. Just like England and France, Sri Lanka and South India have had fractious dynastic and military interactions for millennia.

These dynamics also extended into the religious and cultural realms. As historian Jonathan Walters writes in ‘Buddhist History: The Sri Lankan Pali Vaṃsas and Their Community’, part of the edited volume Querying the Medieval, 10th-century CE Sri Lankan kings claimed descent from the Sun. Meanwhile, on the mainland, the Cholas were doing the exact same thing. In fact, up to the 970s, Sri Lankan rulers were a major threat to Chola power. It was only at the end of the century that the Cholas decisively gained the upper hand.

Thereafter, with Tamil literary and cultural ideas on the ascendant, a period of “Tamilisation” set in in the north of the island, when many local communities absorbed mainland ideas. After the withdrawal of Chola power in the 1070s, a Pali Buddhist cultural renaissance took off, and Tamil-speaking communities, in turn, absorbed island ideas.

In his magisterial work The Buddhist Visnu: Religious Transformation, Politics, and Culture, religious studies professor John Holt assembled evidence from various Sri Lankan chronicles. Holt traced out a vigorous influx of mainland political culture in the 11th and 12th centuries. The Pali chronicle Culavamsa, he notes, praises the powerful Sri Lankan king Parakramabahu I for renovating and expanding both Hindu and Buddhist establishments in the erstwhile Chola provincial capital of Polonnaruwa. Such acts were standard for mainland kings, who tended to depict themselves as transcending sectarian boundaries. Earlier Lankan kings had instead focused their patronage on specific Buddhist monasteries.

But though mainland kings patronised widely, they also maintained a clear religious hierarchy. The Cholas, as historian Daud Ali writes in his book chapter ‘Royal Eulogy as World History’ (Querying the Medieval), claimed to be emanations of Vishnu. However, they imagined him as simply an agent of Shiva, their paramount deity.

Similarly, Parakramabahu I ordered the depiction of Vishnu as an attendant of the Buddha in the Gal Vihara, a rock-cut Buddhist complex in Polonnaruwa. This marked the first active attempt to appropriate Hindu deities into a subordinate position in the Sri Lankan Buddhist pantheon.

Around the same time, as outlined by historian Douglas Ober in Dust on the Throne, mainland Vaishnavite texts were claiming that the Buddha was an avatar of Vishnu. These processes unfolded independently in different parts of South Asia, and with similar political motivations — what might appear to be tolerance is, in fact, state-driven religious politics at work.

A Lankan god’s transformation

In the 13th century, the Sri Lankan prince Virabahu managed to defeat the invading Malayan king Chandrabhanu. Immediately after, according to the Culavamsa, he went to Devinuvara, in the south of the island, to give thanks to an ancient god embodied in an idol of red sandalwood: Upalvan. This is the name by which Sri Lankans known Vishnu today, but as of the 13th century the god had his own rich mythology.

According to Holt (The Buddhist Visnu), Upalvan was most likely an indigenous deity, appearing in some of the oldest Buddhist chronicles, including the Mahavamsa of the 5th century CE. Here, he was described as a “lotus-hued” god, who helped the island’s earliest colonisers battle with nature-deities and settle down.

By the 15th century, following the Pali Buddhist cultural renaissance, and a period of interaction with Tamil-speaking kingdoms in the north of the island, Upalvan assimilated aspects of many Hindu deities. He acquired what Holt calls “a devastatingly powerful war-like image”. According to the Tisara Sandesa, a text from this period, a Buddhist monk in Devinuvara propitiated the god with praises such as “the majestic flames of Upalvan have pierced the heads of enemy kings… those flames pierced the hearts of their wives and were reflected as red rays in their eyes”.

In the linguistically and politically fractious landscape of the 15th century, the god had become politically significant. Other Sandesa texts from the period, writes Holt, requested Upalvan’s protection for armies, ministers, and monks. Yet Upalvan was not a supreme god, granting moksha (liberation) to devotees. He only granted kings power and protection, so that they might establish the Buddhist dharma (cosmic order). He was multifaceted, many things to many people. For instance, when the Ming Chinese admiral Zheng He came to Sri Lanka in the 15th century, he made a dedication to Upalvan, referring to him as the future Buddha Guanyin, or Avalokiteshvara.

Although Devinuvara’s Upalvan received lavish patronage from hopeful local kings, disaster struck the shrine in the 16th century. According to one legend, the Portuguese sacked the temple. Other accounts claim that the red sandalwood idol was taken north, to Alutnuvara, Kandy, Dambulla, Gadaladeniya, or Hanguranketa. All of these were 17th and 18th century centres of Upalvan worship.

But by that time, he was no longer called Upalvan. With the decline of Devinuvara, his older mythology was forgotten, and he became identified with Vishnu.

In the Nayaka kingdom of Kandy, a truly extraordinary melding of mainland and island, Hindu and Buddhist, took place. The Kandy rulers were closely related to the mainland’s Madurai Nayakas, who spoke Tamil and Telugu. During the reign of Kirti Sri Rajasimha of Kandy in the 1750s, poetic works such as the Satara Waran Mal Yahana and Satara Dewala Devi Puvata described Vishnu as one of the island’s four guardian deities, and as a bodhisattva—a future Buddha! His Puranic feats and avatars were repurposed into Sri Lankan myth. In his form of Mohini, he is described as the mother of many Sri Lankan deities. He stands alongside Buddha on the night of his enlightenment.

Propitiated in rituals across Kandyan territories, and entering mainstream Buddhist liturgy, Vishnu was believed to help the Kandy kings in their wars against the Dutch.

Indeed, when the Sri Lankan rebel Gongalegoda Banda performed his ritual to Vishnu in 1848—as we saw in the beginning of this column—he claimed to be a reincarnation of the Kandy king Kirti Sri Rajasimha. His rebellion was not successful, but the Sri Lankan appropriation of Vishnu certainly was. To this day, though controversial, Vishnu in Sri Lanka is a future Buddha, just as in India, Buddha is a former Vishnu.

Jayamiyathul Ulama (ACJU), who appeared before
the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the
Easter attack yesterday (10), has taken several
parcels of food into the commission.

Later investigations have revealed that the parcels
contained Watalappan.

However, some initially raised concerns over the
ACJU General Secretary carrying parcels into the
commission premises, as, on an earlier occasion, an
acting secretary of the organization had secretly
recorded the testimony given by Ven.
Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera on a mobile
phone.

It was the journalists gathered at the premises who
first observed that the ACJU General Secretary
carrying several externally covered parcels into the
commission.

When inquired about this from the police officers
who were on duty in front of the Commission, they
said that the parcels were inspected and it was
observed that they contained watalappan. When
asked what it was being taken for, he had said it was
for the Commission officials.

Police further stated that they did not object to the
parcel being taken away as some counsels usually
carry food on other days as well. Police said an
employee of the commission also came and
assisted in taking the parcels inside.

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations on Wednesday ‘made substantive progress’ in a high-stakes meeting in Istanbul, involving UN and Turkish officials on a deal to resume exports from Black Sea port.

According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), 20 million tons of grain, meant for the global market, are still stuck in Ukraine’s Odessa port. Ukraine used to ship over 50 per cent of its exports from its largest Black Sea port in Odessa. But ever since the war started, a blockade by the Russian Black Sea fleet has prevented exports and imports.

With the conflict in Ukraine in its fifth month and much of the world seeing food prices soar, getting grain and fertilizer shipments moving again from two of the world’s major exporters has become a crucial task for global bodies.

Even as food prices soar internationally, experts believe that Sri Lanka’s economic crisis was set in motion by government’s mismanagement, nepotism and lack of accountability which went unchecked for decades. As the government ran out of foreign reserves, it was unable to import cooking gas and other fuels, food and medicines, causing severe shortages in the island nation.

m4vp0b,Lanka Defends North Korea At UN Human Rights Council; Reaches New Low In Multilateral Diplomacy,post,"Sri Lanka marked another phenomenal low point in multilateral diplomacy by defending the appalling human rights record of one of the worst dictatorial regimes on the face of the earth.

Sri Lankan Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, C. A. Chandraprema made a statement at the human rights council defending North Korea, led by third generation dictator by Kim Jung-un. During an interactive dialogue after a Special Rapporteur presented a damning report on the appalling human rights situation in North Korea, Chandraprema who is himself an accused executioner allegedly involved in at least three assassinations of human rights lawyers, urged “All UN human rights mechanisms to engage in a genuine and constructive dialogue with the Democratic Peoples’ Republic of Korea based on mutual respect and cooperation.”

A 2014 UN Commission of Inquiry found that the government of North Korea committed gross, systematic and widespread rights abuses, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions, and other sexual violence. North Korea operates secretive prison camps where perceived opponents of the government are sent to face torture, starvation and forced labour.

The shocking statement by Chandraprema comes the same week Sri Lanka became the first and only country in the world to recognize the military Junta Myanmar which staged a coup d’etat to unseat the democratically elected administration on February 1.

Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena formally invited the purported Foreign Minister of the military regime, U. Wunna Maung Lwin for a The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) meeting to be chaired by Sri Lanka.

No other government in BIMSTEC which also includes India, Bangladesh and Thailand have recognized the military regime in Myanmar. The formal invitation by the Foreign Minister – Sri Lanka’s top diplomat has granted recognition to what the rest of the world considers an illegitimate regime.

Meanwhile in Geneva, President Nandasena Rajapaka’s handpicked Ambassador has been aligning Sri Lanka with some of the worst human rights violators in history. Last week Colombo Telegraph reported how Candauda Chandraprema similarly defended Eritrea, a country that had openly supported the LTTE even facilitating 10 aircraft to be smuggled to the terrorists’ organization. Foreign Ministry sources confirmed to Colombo Telegraph that Secretary to the Ministry, Admiral Professor Jayanath Colombage has approved Chandraprema to defend the human rights records of some of the worst violators in the world including North Korea, Syria, Eritrea, Belarus and Nicaragua.

These actions however will most likely backfire on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council. The resolutions on North Korea at the UN General Assembly in New York and the Human Rights Council in Geneva are championed by Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). These countries also happen to be two of Sri Lanka’s largest bilateral donors. Both South Korea and Japan are current members of the HRC which is due to vote on a resolution concerning Sri Lanka next week. Bangladesh, which too is a member of the council, will be concerned by Sri Lanka’s recognition of the military junta in Myanmar which it accuses of gross violations which may even tantamount to genocide of the Rohingya community. Nearly a million Rohingya refugees who were chased out of Myanmar since 2017 are looked after by Bangladesh.

A very senior diplomat with previous experience in the Geneva processes commented to Colombo Telegraph that the ‘the inexperienced and cavalier Colombage-Chandraprema combo have managed to drag Sri Lanka to the nadir of multilateral diplomacy and made it impossible even for our friends in the international arena to vote in our favour at the upcoming resolution.’

A resolution on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka is due to be taken up for a vote on either 22nd or 23rd of March. See video of Ambassador Chandraprema’s intervention on behalf of DPRK (North Korea) here (time stamp 47.40-48.25).
